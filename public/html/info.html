 The process that clears the way for the capitalist system, can be none other than the process which takes away from the labourer the possession of his means of production; a process that transforms, on the one hand, the social means of subsistence and of production into capital, on the other, the immediate producers into wage labourers...<br>

"The history of Latin man &#8212; even the Discovery Channel doesn't know our story. You can't start it with 'once upon a time,' because that's usually for white fairy tales.

&emsp;We made this to help Americans get a better sense of the history of Latin America and its complicated relationships with the rest of the world. With the United States in particular, the countries throughout the Americas have had dreams and aspirations, sometimes inspired by us, other times in spite of us, but have also suffered setbacks and threats, often carried out and frequently paid for by our tax dollars. These hurdles have a whole language foreign to most of us: "Structural Adjustment Program," "Coup D'Etat," "Death Squad."<br>
&emsp;But when we turn on the TV or read the paper, pundits repeat the same vague warnings, of threats from the south, of the "dangers" of nationalization, of "American leadership." When you study the history of U.S. foreign policy in Latin America, it can make you wonder what it might sound like to a viewer in Nicaragua or Chile to hear American political thinkers talk about the U.S. asserting itself in their neck of the woods.

&emsp;Throughout this story, there have always been a few Europeans and then Americans who, despite the overwhelming pressure to be part of the problem, actively chose to be part of the solution: reporting on atrocities, assisting resistance, and joining in revolution. And through even the worst terrors, the human capacity to demand and fight for liberation has never been extinguished. And the future is unwritten, many of these struggles continue today, and while we may not be able to lead, in solidarity, we can act. That choice is up to you.
