1	A Model	<p class="entry columns">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/fbanzer.jpg" style="float:right;padding:0px 10px;width:33%;">\r\nIn 1964, the New York Times wrote of Bolivia: &quot;No country in the Western Hemisphere is more dependent on Washington's aid and nowhere has the United States Embassy played a more obtrusive role in establishing that fact.&quot; So in 1970, when President Juan Jose Torres nationalized Gulf Oil properties and tin mines owned by U.S. interests, and tried to establish friendly relations with Cuba and the Soviet Union he was playing with fire. The coup to overthrow Torres, led by U.S. trained officer and Gulf Oil beneficiary Hugo Banzer, had direct support from Washington. When Banzer's forces had a breakdown in radio communications, U.S. Air Force Major Robert Lundin placed the U.S. Air Force radio at their disposal. Once in power, Banzer began a reign of terror. Schools were shut down as hotbeds of &quot;political subversive agitation provoked by anarchists opposed to the new institutional order,&quot; the Soviet Embassy was closed, and Banzer raised a foreign loan to pay Gulf Oil compensation. Within two years, 2,000 people were arrested and tortured without trial. \r\n<br>\r\nAs in Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil, the native Indians were forced off their land and deprived of tribal identity. Tens of thousands of white South Africans were enticed to immigrate with promises of the land stolen from the Indians. Migration Under Secretary Guido Strauss told the U.N. the goal was to create a &quot;white Bolivia.&quot; When Catholic clergy tried to aid the Indians, the regime, with CIA help, launched terrorist attacks against them, and this &quot;Banzer Plan&quot; became a model for similar anti-Catholic actions throughout Latin America.\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his dictatorship, Banzer is elected president in 1997 and serves until 2001, resigning because of cancer.</p>\r\n<p><i>Illustration by Bill Sienkiewicz</i></p>	1964	1964	1	13	Friendly Dictators by Dennis Bernstein and Laura Sydell	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.171711	2015-02-13 04:07:47.171711	\N
2	Our Man in Havana	<p class="entry columns">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/fdbatista.jpg" style="float:left;padding: 0px 10px;width:33%;">\r\nCuban Army Sergeant Fulgencio Batista first seized power in a 1932 coup. He was FDR's handpicked dictator to counteract leftists who had overthrown strongman Gerardo Machado, &quot;the Butcher.&quot; Batista ruled for several years, then left for Miami, returning in 1952 just in time for another coup, against elected president Carlos Prio Socorras. His new regime was recognized in a flash by President Eisenhower. \r\n<br>\r\nUnder Batista, U.S. interests flourished and little was said about democracy. With the loyal support of Batista, Mafioso boss Meyer Lansky developed Havana into an international drug port. Cabinet offices were brought and sold and military officials made huge sums on smuggling and vice rackets. Havana became a fashionable hot spot where America's rich and famous clinked cocktails with mobsters.\r\n<br> As the gap between the rich and poor grew wider, the poor grew impatient. In 1953, Fidel Castro led an armed group of rebels in a failed uprising on the Moncada army barracks. Fidel temporarily fled the country and Batista struck back with a vengeance. Freedom of speech was curtailed and &quot;subversive&quot; teachers, lawyers and public officials were fired from their jobs. Death squads tortured and killed thousands of &quot;communists.&quot; Batista was assisted in his crackdown by Lansky and other members of organized crime who believed Castro would jeopardize their gambling and drug trade. Despite this, Batista remained a friend to Eisenhower and the U.S. until he was finally overthrown by Castro in 1959.</p>\r\n<p><i>Illustration by Bill Sienkiewicz</i></p>	1952	1959	1	32	Friendly Dictators by Dennis Bernstein and Laura Sydell	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.182383	2015-02-13 04:07:47.182383	\N
4	The Floating Gardens	<p class="entry" style="background:white; width:300px; padding:20px;">The Aztec confederation had achieved a high level of efficiency in the Valley of Mexico... ....The Aztecs' irrigation works and artificial islands dazzled Cortes —even though they were not made of gold. The Aztecs also responded in a remarkable way to nature's challenges. The surviving islands in the dried-up lake where Mexico City now rises on native ruins are known to tourists today as &quot;floating gardens.&quot; The Aztecs created these because of the shortage of land in the place chosen for establishing Tenochtitlan. They moved large quantities of mud from the banks and shored up the new mud-islands between narrow walls of reeds until tree roots gave them firmness. Between these exceptionally fertile islands flowed the canals, and on them arose the great Aztec capital, with its broad avenues, its austerely beautiful palaces, and its stepped pyramids: rising magically out of the lake, it was condemned to disappear under the assaults of foreign conquest. Mexico took four centuries to regain the population of those times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<i>Pictured is Diego Rivera's mural in Mexico City's Palacio Nacional showing the city of Tenochtitlan\r\n in Aztec times.</i>\r\n\r\n</p>	1491	1491	2	53	Open veins of latin america, galeano	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.192699	2015-02-13 04:07:47.192699	\N
5	Maya	<p class="entry columns" style="color:white;padding:0px 10px;">\r\nThe other great civilization of Middle America, and the most highly\r\ndeveloped in the arts and sciences, was that of the Mayas, whose territory\r\nencompassed the Yucatan peninsula, southern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize\r\nand parts of Honduras and El Salvador. Its Classic manifestation occurred\r\nbetween ad 300 and 900 in the Peten jungle of northern Guatemala, though\r\nit is believed that Maya culture may have originated in around 1000 bc on\r\nthe coast of the Gulf of Mexico in the area near Veracruz, which also saw\r\nthe rise of Olmec culture. If so, Maya culture would have been remotely\r\ncognate with the Aztec.\r\n<br>\r\nClassic Maya society fell victim to the mysterious decline that first afflicted\r\nTeotihuacan. By the middle of the eighth century the Classic sites in the\r\nPeten had been abandoned. In about 900AD a Post-Classic Maya culture\r\nemerged at the northern tip of the Yucatan peninsula; this was the result of\r\na fusion with elements of central Mexican culture brought to the Yucatan\r\nby Toltec invaders, who conquered Yucatan and made their capital at\r\nChichen Itza, introducing new styles of architecture and art. The power of\r\nChichen Itza had declined by the thirteenth century and it was succeeded by\r\na new empire, whose centre was at Mayapan, but this too had disintegrated\r\ninto smaller states by the time the Spaniards arrived.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThe economy of the Mayas was based on maize, which was cultivated by\r\nslash-and-burn methods that exhausted the soil within a short period. A\r\nconsequence of this form of agriculture was a tendency for peasants to live\r\nin makeshift settlements of pole and thatch rather than in villages. Maya\r\ncities were therefore less concentrated than those in central Mexico, and were\r\nprimarily religious and administrative centres, where the priesthood and the\r\nnobility lived, though it appears that there was more residential settlement\r\nby the common people than was previously thought, especially in the main\r\ncities of northern Yucatan like Chichen Itza and Mayapan.\r\n<br>\r\nMaya kingdoms were ruled by a leader with religious as well as political\r\nauthority; society was divided into a class of commoners on the one hand\r\nand an upper class of priests, \r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/mayansculpture.jpg" style="float: right; width:100%; margin:0px 9px 0px 0px; ">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwarriors and administrators on the other.\r\n'Empires' were created when a kingdom was able to exact tribute and labour\r\nfrom other smaller states. Like the Aztecs, the Mayas believed that a succession\r\nof worlds had been created and destroyed, and that the present era would\r\nalso have an apocalyptic ending. To put off this calamity they sacrificed\r\nhuman beings and practiced various forms of expiation. Their concern with\r\nthe fate of the cosmos produced a complex calendrical system and a well-\r\ndeveloped mathematics, which discovered the concept of zero several centuries before any other people in history. Hieroglyphic writing appears on stelae, on temple walls and doorways, and in a number of codices; otherwise\r\nMaya culture was oral and rich in mythology, of which something has been\r\npreserved in the Popol Vuh, the sacred book of the Quiche Maya of\r\nGuatemala, which was written in the European alphabet from oral sources\r\nafter the Spanish Conquest. In architecture the Mayas surpassed other Amer-Indian civilizations; they were highly skilled in stone sculpture and mural painting, as is evidenced by the frescoes at Bonampak in Chiapas.\r\n</p>	1491	1491	2	45	The Penguin History of Latin America, Edwin Williamson	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.202216	2015-02-13 04:07:47.202216	\N
7	The Treaty of Tordesillas	<img src="/mapimages/tordesillasblink.gif" style="position:absolute;right:0px;top:0px;">\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="width:460px;">\r\n<i>The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494, allowed Portugal to occupy Latin America territories below a dividing line traced by the Pope.</i>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Catholic Kings turned to the papacy, following the precedent set by the Portuguese, who had secured a formal papal donation of rights of sovereignty 'from Cape Bojador towards Guinea and beyond'. From a compliant Spanish pope, Alexander VI, they obtained what they wanted: similar rights in 'all islands and mainlands whatever, found or to be found' in the area beyond a national line of demarcation that was to be formally agreed between the crowns of Portugal and Spain in the treaty of Tordesillas of 1494. Alexander VI's bulls of 1493 might have been regarded as unnecessary in view of the Roman Law principle laid down in the Siete Partidas that possession belonged to the first occupiers of the land. But papal authorization gave an extra degree of security to Castilian claims against any attempted challenge by the Portuguese, and raised the enterprise of the Indies to the level of a holy undertaking by linking Castile's exclusive rights to an equally exclusive obligation to win the heathen to the Faith. This missionary enterprise, solemnly entrusted to the crown of Castile, provided it with a moral justification for conquest and colonization which at once reinforced and transcended claims deriving in one form or another from the fact of first discovery. The crown, having moved to ensure its primacy in the international arena, also moved to ensure its primacy in Columbus's enterprise. The fitting out of the fleet for his return voyage to Hispaniola - a fleet, this time, of seventeen instead of only three ships.\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	1494	1494	1	42	Open Veins of Latin America & The Cambridge History of Latin America, Vol 1	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.212281	2015-02-13 04:07:47.212281	\N
8	Requerimiento	<p class="entry " style="background-color:white;padding:15px;">A handful of cavalry, 200 foot soldiers, and a few specially trained dogs decimated the Indians. More than 500, shipped to Spain, were sold as slaves in Seville and died miserably. Some theologians protested and the enslavement of Indians was formally banned at the beginning of the sixteenth century. Actually it was not banned but blessed: before each military action the captains of the conquest were required to read to the Indians, without an interpreter but before a notary public, a long and rhetorical Requerimiento exhorting them to adopt the holy Catholic faith:\r\n&quot;<i>If you do not, or if you maliciously delay in so doing, I certify that with God's help I will advance powerfully against you and make war on you wherever and however I am able, and will subject you to the yoke and obedience of the Church and of their majesties and take your women and children to be slaves, and as such I will sell and dispose of them as their majesties may order, and I will take your possessions and do you all the harm and damage that I can.</i>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n<span class="bigquote" style="font-size:120%">Other <i>Requerimiento</i> Excerpts</span>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Why it was called that:</strong><br>\r\n<span style="margin-left: 20px;">\r\n"I <i>require</i> that you understand carefully this proclamation, take\r\nit utterly seriously, and deliberate about it for an appropriate\r\namount of time.

11	Indigenous cacique Urracá fights conquistador Francisco Pizarro	<p class="entry" style="font-size: 26px; line-height: 32px;"> \r\n<img src="../mapimages/urraca.png" style="height:203px;padding:0px 7px;float:right">\r\nUrracá wins several battles. In one, he creates a rumor of gold to divide the Spaniards leaving them open to ambushes. At his defeat, he refuses to be enslaved. Different versions of events claim he is killed in a battle at his home, or that he is captured and taken to Spain in chains.\r\n<br><br />\r\nToday, Urracá's face is found on the one centesimo or &quot;centavo&quot; coin.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px; clear: both;">\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 12px;">The attention of Pedrarias was directed to</span> the west and north of Panama, rather than to the east and south. In the sierra of Veragua, on the south coast, dwelt a powerful cacique named Urracá. He was reported to have much gold; so Espinosa by sea, and Pizarro by land started out after the mountain chieftain. Urracá sent his women, children, and infirm to a place of safety and fiercely attacked the Spaniards with his fighting men. The licentiate was getting the worst of it, when Hernando de Soto came up with thirty of Pizarro's men and saved the Spaniards. When the latter retreated, the Indians fell upon them in the defiles of the mountains, and it was only by the most desperate efforts that the white men got back to the ships.\r\n<br> \r\n&quot;Espinosa wished to found a colony at Nata, the most attractive place yet visited on the Isthmus. He left at Nata fifty men under Companon, and returned to Panama. Urracá threatens Companon by night and kills one of his men, but is scared off by a single Spanish soldier. Runners are despatched for aid, and Hernando Ponce de Leon and the governor himself appear with reinforcements. They go out after Urracá and fight for five days, but are forced to come back to Nata, leaving the cacique unbeaten. Pedrarias divides the lands and captive Indians among such of his soldiers as elect to settle at Nata and sixty choose to remain and start a pueblo. Diego de Albites is left as the governor's lieutenant, and finally makes peace with Urracá; which displeases Pedrarias who appoints Francisco Companon to govern Nata.\r\n<br>\r\n&quot;Chiriqui was the name of a province west of Veragua, and Benito Hurtado was sent there to found a settlement. The country was thinly populated, and the two principal chiefs, Vareclas and Burica, submitted without resistance. For two years the colony remained unmolested; but the Spaniards became unbearable, and the Indians rose in revolt. Urracá again took up arms, but was induced to visit Nata under solemn assurance of safety. When in their power, the Spaniards put the chief in irons and sent him to Nombre de Dios, with the intention of shipping him to Spain. Luckily, the brave cacique burst his bonds and returned to his home to wage a relentless warfare against the white invaders. Like his prototype the Quibian, on the north coast of Veragua, Urracá escaped the vengeance of the Christians and died among his own people.&quot;<br><Br />\r\n<span class="source" style="font-style: italic;">Old Panama and Castilla del Oro by Charles Loftus &amp; Grant Anderson</span>\r\n\r\n</p>	1516	1516	2	59		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.249279	2015-02-13 04:07:47.249279	\N

The Indians received them as if they were their friends and relatives showing every mark of respect and affection, supplying them every day with food, the best that could be got. It is the generous custom of all the Indians in the New World to give liberally to meet the needs of the Spaniards from whatever they may have.<br>\r\nThese men began to make a large house of wood in which they could all live as this was what they had alleged they had come to do. When the time came to apply palm leaves to the supports and some way up the walls had been covered so that those without could not see within, the Spaniards said that they wanted to finish the house quickly and so put many Indians inside to help while the Spaniards went outside and drew their swords to prevent any Indians leaving. Then they began to threaten the defenseless Indians with death should they attempt to escape.They bound the Indians as prisoners while some, forcing their way out, were cut to pieces by the Spaniards.<br>\r\n Some who had managed to escape though wounded, and others from the pueblo who had not entered the house, seized their bows and arrows and retired to another building in the pueblo to defend themselves.\r\n<td>\r\n\r\n<td  width="700px"  valign="top" style="padding-top:370px;">\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\n When one or two hundred of the Indians were inside holding the gate, the Spaniards set fire to the house and burnt them all alive. With the prisoners who amounted to about 180-200 men whom they had been able to catch, they returned to their ship and set sail for the Island of San Juan (Puerto Rico) where they sold half of them for slaves; thence they went to Hispaniola where they sold the remaining half of the Indians. \r\n<br>\r\nHaving reprimanded the Captain for this dastardly treachery and evil attack when I met him at this time in the said Island of San Juan, he replied: &quot;I did, Sir, what I was ordered; those who sent me instructed me to take them how I could either by war or in peace.&quot; He also told me that in all his life he had never found Indians so kind and ready with assistance as those in the Island of Trinidad. I repeat this to emphasize the importance of his confession and to show how great was his sin.\r\n<br>\r\n Such things have often been done on the mainland repeatedly, the Indians being taken and enslaved without restriction. Should such things be allowed to continue and should Indians taken in this way be sold as slaves?"\r\n</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<p style="font-style:italic; position:relative;left:660px;font-size:smaller;">\r\nPictured, a detail of Johann Georg Kohl's reproduction of Diego Ribeiro's <br>\r\n1529 map of the eastern coast of the New World (red detailing added)</p>	1516	1516	1	72	Bartolome  de las Casas quoted in Eric Williams' History of the People of Trinidad and Tobago	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.258492	2015-02-13 04:07:47.258492	\N
13	 Enriquillo 	<p class="entry columns">A chieftain named &quot;Enriquillo&quot; by the Spaniards leads the last great rebellion of Taino Indians on the Island of Hispaniola\r\nThe Taino cacique (&quot;chieftan&quot;) Guarocuya, better known as Enriquillo (a diminutive form of his baptismal name, Enrique) was a grandnephew of the great Cacica (&quot;chieftainess&quot;) Anacaoina and one of the first native children taught to be converted to Catholicism. The friars taught Enriquillo to read and write Castilian and to act &quot;civilized.&quot; His achievements did not prevent him from being assigned as a laborer to a Spaniard named Francisco de Valenzuela of San Juan de la Maguana in 1514, during the last great division of Hispaniola's Indians, and then passed on to Francisco's son and heir, Andres. \r\n<br>\r\nEnriquillo cooperated with the Spaniards, ordering his people to mine gold and grow food for them, until 1519 when Andres seized not only enriquillo's prized mare but also his wife, Mencia, to whom he had been married to in a sanctified Catholic ceremony. \r\nEnriquillo went to the town's leading Spaniard, Pedro de Vadillo, to demand justice, but Vadillo reprimanded him for speaking out against Andres. Furious, Enriwuillo consulted the church fathers in the capital, and they approached the royal Audencia (government council) with Enriquillo's demands for justice. Although the Spanish officials in the capital sympathized with the cacique and order Mencia's release, Enriquillo was forced to take their letter back to Vadillo, who threatened to jail him or put him in the stocks if her pursued the issue. Enriquillo gathered up Mencia and the rest of his people and led them to the desolate lands called Bahoruco, and from there he staged successful raids against the Spaniards for the next 13 years. As his fame spread, rebellios Indians and African slaves joined him. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span class="caption" style="float:right;max-width:50%">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/tainoscaciqueenriquillo.jpg" style="max-width:100%; padding:7px;"><br>\r\nThe statue of Enriquillo</span>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the years, numerous heavily armed bands of Spaniards were sent to dislodge Enriquillo, but they had no success until the 1533 expedition of Captain Francisco de Barrioneuvo, who bore promises of a pardon and liberty from King Charles V—and who took along the Dominican friar Bartolome de Las Casas to convince the Cacique of the inscereity of the offer. (Las Casas described Enriquillo as &quot;grave and strict,&quot; neither handsome nor ugly, tall, with a well-proportioned body.) Enriquillo reconciled with the king and agreed, henceforth, to return runaway slaves to Spanish officials. Later, a group of escaped slaves attacked the town of Azua, where Enriquillo was buried in 1535, to retaliate for his actions against black slaves. \r\n<br>\r\nBohoruco remained a refuge for rebellious cimarones (&quot;runaway slaves&quot;) until the late-nineteenth century. Today, there is a monumental sculpture dedicated to Enriquillo on the main road to Bahoruco, and the large salt lake in the region is known as Lago Enriquillo. The region is still considered unruly, for it is a center of voodoo.\r\n</p>	1519	1533	2	38	The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.27019	2015-02-13 04:07:47.27019	\N

868	Llido	<div class="page" data-title="1"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/chilellido1974.jpg" class="floatright">\r\nAntonio Llido Mengual was born April 29, 1936 in Valencia, Spain. When the Republican government transferred from Madrid \r\nto Valencia, Valencia came under severe attack by Franco,  forcing the fall of the democratic government. Llido grew up and was ordained a priest in 1963 under the authoritarian  regime of Franco that killed 23 priests in the Basque country  alone. His working class family instilled democratic values in him, and his social commitment was already evident as a young parish priest in the villages of Balones and Quatretondeta, a poor community sustained by subsistence agriculture. \r\n<br>Fr.  Antonio Llido arrived in Chile in 1969, sent by the Episcopal Commission for Missions and Cooperation between Churches. \r\nHis work as a priest was conducted in Quillota, Valparaiso  Diocese, and a poor farm working community much like the villages \r\nhe left behind in Spain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFr. Jesus Rodriguez arrived in Chile in 1965 also from Spain, and was parish priest in the poblacion of La Victoria from \r\n1993, recalled:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n"From the moment he arrived in Chile, the poverty, misery, and the anguish of the poor the deeply affected him. Such was the situation he observed throughout the Valparaiso area. He lived very modestly, eating what the poor ate, living from his earnings as a French teacher. During the harvest season, He joined the humble farm workers working with them, and worked as an unskilled laborer." <br>\r\n<br>\r\n"Chile was highly politicized in those years. Working classes had a great yearning for justice. And with reason, because many social abuses existed. Antonio Llido's life was closely tied to groups of the poorest workers. Within that world of working people, various political groups advocated changes for a new society. He associated with many of them and had good relations with these groups that had such a strong yearning for justice."\r\n<br>\r\nThe  abysmal conditions of Quillota farm workers deeply affected  the new Spanish priest, forming a base for a strong social \r\nand political commitment. Antonio Llido belonged to "The 80,"  a group of Chilean and foreign priests, who participated in \r\nthe organization Cristianos por el Socialismo, that supported  presidential candidacy of Salvador Allende.\r\n<br>\r\nIn a letter he wrote to a friend on March 9, 1971, Llido described \r\nhis vocation: <br>\r\n"Faith  in a distant, ephemeral God, solver of problems by house call,  has also been left behind. Increasingly I come to understand  my religion and priesthood as a commitment to the society in which I live. A commitment to men and women who struggle for a new social order where slavery has no place, that prepares people to fully realize themselves, in which injustice and \r\nexploitation cease to be our daily bread. I understand Jesus Christ as very related to this matter. I understand Jesus \r\nChrist as each one of my brothers and sisters. I understand that in uniting with them in this struggle, perhaps I will \r\nbe capable of overcoming the small and large personal needs that are only relevant because they impede me from fully giving \r\nmyself to this task."\r\n<br>\r\nThe  Arrest and Search for the Missing Priest\r\n<br>\r\nFather Rodriguez again takes up the story:\r\n<br>\r\n"After the military coup, he was advised to return to his native land. He responded that he would not leave. In the hour of such hardship, he would not abandon the modest people with whom he had lived. He wished to share their lot. Still, shortly after the coup he was forced to leave the area because the military were looking for him, to kill him just as they looked for so many people. All of \r\nus who lived in Chile in those years bear witness of that fact. He went to Santiago, where he continued helping people \r\nwho were fleeing. He fled with those who were fleeing. Even though he himself was in danger, he continued helping others \r\nwho were persecuted. Once more, he was counseled to leave Chile, and once more he chose to stay and run the same fate \r\nshared by the poor and persecuted." <br>\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="2"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/chilellido1974.jpg" class="floatright">\r\nAfter the military coup, the military regime's security forces looked for him in Quillota, forcing him to leave the area. Llido \r\nwas hidden first in Valparaiso, and then in Santiago, where \r\nhe was arrested.\r\n<br>\r\nThe  last letter his family received, dated September 1974 and signed with the alias "Teresa Vazquez," indicated that Llido was aware of the risks he faced:\r\n<br>\r\nI do not wish to be melodramatic, but at some point I have to say it. If something bad should happen to me, I want you to know that my commitment to what I am doing has been freely contracted, with the joy of knowing that this is precisely what I should be doing at this moment. Fear is constantly present in each one of us, because none of us are movie heroes. But we refuse to accept that fear must condition our actions and prevent us from doing what with a cool head and fervent heart we understand should be done." \r\n<br>On October 1, 1974 Antonio Llido was arrested in downtown Santiago. \r\n<br>\r\nFather Jesus Rodriguez attempted to intervene for many people after the coup. He was also very concerned about the situation of \r\nAntonio Llido. Accompanied by another Catalan priest, several times he visited Valparaiso Bishop Emilio Tagle who had good \r\nrelations with the military.<br>\r\n"In March 1975, I remember he told us: "I have just spoken to a Minister of State who says Llido is under arrest but he is well." We visited him again during the month  of May, and once more he told us, "I have spoken to a very  high official. He tells me that this situation will be resolved well." We doubted everything he told us, but never did we tell him, 'You are very naive.' In June we visited him again, and this time, he was indeed disturbed. He got up, nervously pacing his office, and said, 'Now, I can't understand it. An important Minister of State has just told me that this young priest was being transferred to another place of detention, and en route, he escaped.' He was very nervous. On our previous visits, he thought what they were telling him was true. But this time, he could not believe it." \r\n<br>\r\nMartyrdom \r\n<br>\r\nThe terrible truth that the anonymous high official of State concealed from Bishop Tagle was that DINA agents had taken Antonio Llido to the interrogation and torture center at 1315 Jose Domingo Ca&ntilde;as Street in Santiago, known as Ollague Barracks. \r\nDuring the second week of October, he was transferred to cell 13 at Cuatro Alamos, a detention center where prisoners were \r\nheld incommunicado. He remained there until October 24, when he and other prisoners were taken to an unknown location. \r\nSince that day, the Spanish priest Antonio Llido became one of hundreds of persons forcibly disappeared in Chile. \r\n<br>\r\nNumerous witnesses, who like Llido, were prisoners at Jose Domingo Ca&ntilde;as have testified in court that the priest was severely tortured. We highlight the testimonies of Julio Laks Feller and his wife Rosalia Martinez Cereceda, who shared a prison cell with \r\nAntonio Llido.\r\n<br>\r\nTestimony of Julio Laks Feller and Rosalia Martinez Cereceda \r\n<br>\r\nJulio Laks testified before the Spanish consulate on November 27, 1977. [ Laks recognized that &quot;the conditions of detention made it difficult to measure the lapse of time,&quot; accounting for the discrepancy in dates.] His testimony forms part of the \r\ncriminal complaint, as cited below: <br>\r\n                  <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="1">"Between September \r\n26 and 30 of the same year [1974] Fr. Antonio Llido Mengual \r\nwas placed in our cell. Over the course of two or three days, \r\nFr. Llido was taken from the cell many times for interrogation. \r\nEach time he returned in worse physical condition. After three \r\ndays he moved with great difficulty due to the pain inflicted \r\nin torture. His shirt was stained in blood and he apparently \r\nhad internal hemorrhages and torn muscles. On one occasion \r\na doctor who worked for the DINA examined his vital signs \r\nand recommended immediate hospitalization. In response to \r\nthe doctor's urgent recommendation, the official whose last \r\nname was Morel [Marcelo Moren Brito] responded that this was \r\nimpossible, as the interrogations had not finished. The doctor \r\ninsisted in vain, expressing his sense of powerlessness and \r\nindignation." <br>\r\n<br>\r\n"Despite his physical state and the abuse inflicted by DINA \r\nagents, who grossly mocked his condition as priest, he found \r\nstrength to console his cellmates, sharing his crusts of bread \r\nor fruit peels to help us survive." </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Concerning her detention with Antonio Llido, Rosalia Martinez \r\nCereceda stated in her own sworn testimony of December 19, \r\n1999:</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font size="1">"There I also met the Spanish priest Antonio \r\nLlido. He was accused of having hidden and protected people \r\nof the MIR who were persecuted. Antonio Llido never denied \r\nthis, saying that he could not lie to them. The guards would \r\nlaugh at him, and commented that when Antonio Llido was being \r\ntortured he was asked to name people, and he would say that \r\nhe could not give them the names. 'And why not?' the guards \r\nasked. 'Because of my principles,' Antonio replied in his \r\nSpanish accent, which the guards imitated." </font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the second week of October 1974, Julio Laks was transferred \r\nto Cuatro Alamos. A few days later, from the window of his \r\ncell, he saw Antonio Llido arrive and placed in the adjoining \r\ncell (number 13): "His state of health was somewhat better, \r\nbut he suffered great pain, as Icould note from his gestures." \r\nJulio Laks never saw him again. </font></p>\r\n                  <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>\r\n                  <p align="JUSTIFY"><b><i><font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="#top"><font color="ee3936">Return \r\nto top</font></a></font></i></b></p>\r\n                  <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>\r\n                  <hr>\r\n                  <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>\r\n                  <p ><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="003399"><b><a name="&quot;That one's"></a>&quot;That \r\none's not a priest; he's a Marxist .&quot;</b></font></p>\r\n                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> On November 13, 1974 General \r\nAugusto Pinochet granted a rare interview to an interfaith \r\ngroup of clergy, members of the Pro Paz Committee founded \r\nin the weeks following the coup to aid people in detention. \r\nMonsignor Fernando Ariztia, Lutheran Bishop Helmuth Frenz, \r\nthe Jesuit priest Fernando Salas and Rabbi Angel Kreiman had \r\nrequested the interview to express their concern for 11 persons \r\nwho had disappeared after detention. General Pinochet received \r\nthe ecumenical delegation in his office in the Diego Portales \r\nbuilding, and to the surprise of his visitors, he received \r\nthem alone, without the presence of any assistant.</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> \r\n</font></p>\r\n                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The clergy were especially concerned \r\nabout the situation of David Silberman, CODELCO director who \r\nhad been abducted from the Penitenciary in Santiago, and the \r\ncase of Fr. Antonio Llido who they knew had been arrested \r\nby the DINA and was held in the Jose Domingo Ca&ntilde;as \r\ndetention and torture center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelmut Frenz, today Pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church \r\nof Germany, testified on June 30, 2003 before Judge Jorge \r\nZepeda regarding the interview with Pinochet. Frenz recalled:<br>\r\n<font size="1">&quot;</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="1">I \r\nwondered how the General would justify or evade the crude \r\nproblem we would pose.

Upon concluding our meeting, \r\nthe General told us something that I recall nearly word for \r\nword because it was so extraordinary. This is what he told \r\nus: 'As clergy you can give yourselves the luxury of being \r\nmerciful. But I am in charge of this country which is infected \r\nwith the bacteria of Communism.

In the eighteenth century the surviving Indians still assured many generations to come of a cozy life. Since their defeated gods persisted in Spanish memory, there were saintly rationalizations aplenty for the victors' profits from their toil; the Indians were pagans and deserved nothing better.</p>	1536	1704	2	54	Open Veins of Latin America	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.324271	2015-02-13 04:07:47.324271	\N

25	Ridding the Land of Spaniards	<p class="entry columns" style="width:440px;">The Indian did not always stay conquered. The biggest of their battles to remain free broke out in 1541. The <i>Mixton War</i>, as it was labeled, set aflame the territory lying between Jalisco and Zacatecas. A few years before, Nuno de Guzman had inflicted his brand of civilization on it, killing and enslaving at will. His legacy of cruelty was kept alive by Spanish encomenderos. The war, which lasted two years, erupted on the edges of Zacatecas, where the Caxcanes, a sedentary farming people, blocked the northward Spanish march. Its leaders, native priests mostly, gave the war a profoundly religious, anti-Christian character. The Indians burned churches, destroyed monasteries, and cut down crosses. If they triumphed, so their banners proclaimed, they would extirpate all christian vestiges, restore the anciet religions, revive old customs, and rid the land of the spaniards. The defeat of the Indians in the Mixton War opened the way for the Spanish occupation of Zacatecas. The war brought death to Pedro de Alvarado, who, fleeing from the Indians, had a horse fall upon him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="background-color:white;width:384px;position:absolute;bottom:10px; left: 470px;font-style:italic;padding:7px;">A 1540 map of Nueva Galicia from shortly after the indigenous uprising.

28	Cerro Rico of Potosi 	<p class="entry columns">\r\n<img src="../mapimages/boliviapotosi2.gif" style="height:150px;padding:7px;float:left">\r\nIn the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the Cerro Rico of Potosi (Mexico's Guanajuato and Zacatecas silver mines had their boom much later) was the hub of Latin American colonial life: around it, in one way or another, revolved the Chilean economy, which sent it wheat, dried meat, hides, and wines; the cattle-raising and crafts of Cordoba and Tucuman in Argentina, which supplied it with draft animals and textiles; the mercury mines of Huancavelica; and the Arica region whence the silver was shipped to Lima, chief administrative center of the period. In the independence period the area, now a part of Bolivia, still had a larger population than what is now Argentina. A century and a half later Bolivia's population is almost six times smaller than Argentina's.\r\n<br>\r\nPotosian society, sick with ostentation and extravagance, left Bolivia with only a vague memory of its splendors, of the ruins of its churches and palaces, and of 8 million Indian corpses. Any one of the diamonds encrusted in a rich caballero's shield was worth more than what an Indian could earn in his whole life under the mitayo, (A mitayo is an Indian who pays a mita. or tribute, usually in the form of forced labor in public works, especially the mines) but the caballero took off with the diamonds. If it were not a futile exercise, Bolivia—now one of the world's most poverty-stricken countries—could boast of having nourished the wealth of the wealthiest. In our time Potosi is a poor city in a poor Bolivia: &quot;The city which has given most to the world and has the least,&quot; as an old Potosian lady, enveloped in a mile of alpaca shawl, told me when we talked on the Andalusian patio of her two-century-old house. Condemned to nostalgia, tortured by poverty and cold, Potosi remains an open wound of the colonial system in America: a still audible &quot;J'accuse.&quot; \r\n<br>\r\nIn three centuries Potosi's Cerro Rico consumed 8 million lives. The Indians, including women and children, were torn from their agricultural communities and driven to the Cerro. Of every ten who went up into the freezing wilderness, seven never returned. Luis Capoche, an owner of mines and mills, wrote that &quot;the roads were so covered with people that the whole kingdom seemed on the move.&quot; In their communities the Indians saw &quot;many afflicted women returning without husbands and with many orphaned children&quot; and they knew that &quot;a thousand deaths and disasters&quot; awaited them in the mines. The Spaniards scoured the countryside for hundreds of miles for labor. Many died on the way, before reaching Potosi, but it was the terrible work conditions in the mine that killed the most people. Soon after the mine began operating, in 1550, the Dominican monk Domingo de Santo Tomas told the Council of the Indies that Potosi was a &quot;mouth of hell&quot; which swallowed Indians by the thousands every year, and that rapacious mine owners treated them &quot;like stray animals.&quot; Later Fray Rodrigo de Loaysa said: &quot;These poor Indians are like sardines in the sea. Just as other fish pursue the sardines to seize and devour them, so everyone in these lands pursues the wretched Indians.&quot; Chiefs of Indian communities had to replace the constantly dying mitayos with new men between eighteen and fifty years old. The huge stone-walled corral where Indians were assigned to mine and mill owners is now used by workers as a football ground. The mitayos' jail—a shapeless mass of ruins—can still be seen at the entrance to Potosi.</p>	1550	1699	5	13	Open Veins of Latin America	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.350368	2015-02-13 04:07:47.350368	\N
29	BAYANO!	<p class="entry shen" style="padding-left:300px;color:white;font-size:1.5em;position:relative;top:-78px;">King Bayano leads escaped slaves in the largest sixteenth-century revolt against Spanish colonial rule in Panama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;margin-left:270px;position:relative;top:-95px;">\r\nKing Bayano led the largest revolt against Spanish colonial rule in Panama in the sixteenth century. Bayano, a Mandinka and possibly muslim, was one of the four hundred Africans captured in West Africa for enslavement in Panama in 1552.  African slaves were needed because the Spanish has killed off most of the local tribes. The ship carrying the Africans sank, and the group escaped. Since they landed as free men they elected Bayano (who was reported to be a royal back home in his native Mandinka tribe in Africa) as their King and consequently fought the Spaniards to maintain their independence. This was the first rebellion against colonial authorities in Americas.\r\n<br>\r\nBayano was supported by the <i>Cimarrones</i>, the Spanish term for black runaway slaves who married Indians and resides in self-governing areas called <i>Palenques</i>. Bayano and his hundreds of Cimarrones lived at Ronconcholon, where his group grew stronger and fugitive community thrived. Since he could not abide by the horrific ill-treatment carried out by the Spanish, Bayano and his group fought the Spaniards in various ways for five years. He also gained support from the Scottish and the English pirates who enjoyed working with him to thwart the Spanish. Bayano frequently attacked mule train caravans that travel from Peru, across Panama, along Carmino Real (King's Highway), frequently procured gold and silver from the caravans, which seriously affected Spain's profit from its enterprises in the New World.\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spanish sent governor and conquistador Pedro de Ursua (1521 - 1561), who quickly realized that he was incapable of fighting the most experienced Cimarrones in their home terrain. De Ursua made a number of agreements to end the fighting, but in 1556, he deceitfully drew Bayano and his men into peace negotiation to discuss a truce, and the group came unarmed. De Ursua had 32 of Bayano's men poisoned, and only a few escaped as Bayano and his closest men were seized by the Spaniards.\r\n<br>\r\nIn a formal meeting with the Spanish viceroy, who lauded him for his tenacity, Bayano signed a peace treaty. His followers were allowed to retain their freedom. Bayano was freed, exiled to Peru, and then to Spain where he lived in a relative comfort due to the wealth he has amassed. A formal treaty that liberated the Cimarrones followed. Bayano died in Spain, but he remains an important historical figure in Panama where a dam, a valley, and a river bears his name. <span class="entry_source">Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion</span>\r\n</p>	1552	1557	6	59		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.359906	2015-02-13 04:07:47.359906	\N
18	The Slow Boil	<p class="entry columns3">\r\n&emsp;When the Spanish arrived in the Caribbean in 1492, they encountered\r\ntwo major groups of indigenous peoples. The Carib were found throughout the islands, but specifically populated the Lesser Antilles, while the Arawak chiefly inhabited the Greater Antilles. When these indigenous peoples were first encountered, the Spanish simply called them <i>Indios</i> or identified them according to the name of their respective chiefs, villages, or island location. The name <i>Taino</i>, which came into common use only in the early decades of the twentieth century and by which these tribal groups are generally known today was assigned to them by historians and anthropologists to refer to the entire indigenous population of the western Caribbean region. \r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;In 1498, in an attempt to placate discontented colonists on the island of Hispaniola, Christopher Columbus distributed to each them a parcel of land and the preexisting Indian communities on each. Spanish colonists could then force the Indians on their land to work without the compensation of wages in a state of serfdom or slavery, known in Spanish as <i>encomienda</i> or <i>repartimiento</i>. Juan Ponce de Leon, appointed by Governor Nicholas de Orvando, arrived at Puerto Rico and began to colonize the island in 1508. With a portion of the Spanish fleet and the authorization of the Crown, he began to exploit the island in the search for gold and captured native Taino to work as slaves on Hispaniola.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Three years later, the Taino of Puerto Rico revolted against the rule of the Spanish with little success. Ponce de leon ordered that six thousand be shot, but many fled the island. The following year, forty slaves owned by Diego Colon, the son of Christopher Columbus, resisted for several months before finally being caught and executed. The Dominican friars on Hispaniola, disheartened by the slow extermination of the Arawak, suggested that slaves, both white and black, should be imported to the islands. In 1512, in order to discourage Portuguese slave smuggling and in response to the writings of the Dominican friars, the Spanish government began to grant licenses to bring slaves directly from Africa to the Americas.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;In 1527, the first major slave rebellion occurred in Puerto Rico as dozens of slaves, likely of both African and indigenous origin, fought against the Spanish colonists in a brief and ultimately ill-fated revolt. The few slaves who escaped during this uprising retreated into the mountains where they resided as maroons with surviving Taino. Similar uprisings continued until the nineteenth century when slavery was finally abolished on Puerto Rico. As several areas of the island were only sparsely settled during these subsequent revolts, many slaves preferred flight into the countryside and life as maroons with the indigenous people rather than open revolt.</p>	1527	1527	7	67	Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion	large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:47.369922	2015-02-13 04:07:47.369922	\N

It was seen as threat by influential politicians in neighboring countries, and its support for Chilean and Argentine dissidents in exile caused Argentina and Chile to wage war separately against the confederation.

15	Wolofs Lead the Hispaniola Revolt	<div class="page" data-title="The Wolof"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="width:550px;">\r\n<br>&emsp;In 1522, a momentous African uprising took place on the island of Hispaniola in what is today the Dominican Republic. Led by Wolof men from Senegal, it was the first recorded in a series of elaborate African revolts that shook colonial Spanish America. It paved the way for legislation that restricted the further introduction of Wolof and Muslims into the Spanish colonies. \r\n<br>&emsp;The Wolof presence in Hispaniola went back to the very first years of the arrival of Africans on the island in 1502. They had been the prisoners of several wars that took place in Senegambia in the early sixteenth century. The Jolof Empire , founded in the thirteenth century by a Muslim dynasty, had started to disintegrate with the transfer of power from the African interior, where societies had flourished through contact with the north via the trans-Saharan trade to the Atlantic coast following the arrival of the Portuguese and the establishment of trade relations with the newcomers. Each armed conflict that pined its vassal kingdoms against Jolof sent Wolof, Mandinka, Tukulor, and Fulani prisoners of war to Hispaniola, Mexico, Peru, and Colombia as slaves. People from the Senegambia region were the largest groups represented among the slaves introduced in early Spanish America, and many of them were Muslims.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe uprising started on December 25, 1522, four miles from Santo Domingo on the sugar plantation of Admiral Don Diego Colon, the viceroy of the Indies and Christopher Columbus's son. The date had been carefully chosen. Usually on that day the Spaniards\r\nwere drunk or tired from the festivities of the night before. The Wolof insurgents met with a group of about twenty men from other plantations and armed with the machetes they used to cut cane, they killed nine whites and burned fields. By December 28, they had reached the estate of Melchor de Castro, a large mine owner, killed another Spaniard, and captured a black man and twelve enslaved Indians. The insurgents had already killed twelve men when they came about a mile from Ocoa, sixteen miles from Santo Domingo, near the plantation of Zuazo. Their objective was to enter the estate, execute the Spaniards, and rally to their cause the 120 enslaved men and women who worked there.\r\n<br>&emsp;By then news of the revolt had spread, and the surprise effect was lost. Spanish settlers had rounded up all the soldiers, militia, and horsemen they could find. On December 29, they came in sight of the Africans near Zuazo's plantation. The horsemen charged them and killed a few, but the Africans did not panic as was expected; they opened their ranks, let the horses pass, and regrouped to face the countercharge. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Spanish Fear"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="width:550px;">\r\n\r\nWolof warriors were used to cavalry warfare. The king of Jolof had a company of eight to ten thousand mounted men according to the Portuguese who had visited the region between 1504 and 1506. Ironically. the Spaniards had asked for the forced introduction of the Wolof into their colonies because they needed men who were used to cattle raising and the handling of horses, and the slave ship captains found them in Senegambia.\r\n<br>&emsp;As the insurgents regrouped, they killed six Spaniards and wounded several, including Melchor de Castro, but the settlers were more numerous and better armed and they crushed the uprising. The surviving Africans took to the hills where they were pursued by a mixed force of Spaniards and Indians, and within a few days they were captured.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe insurgents had remained a small group, and the Spaniards were relieved, because few as they were, they still had managed to inflict casualties among the slaveholders and caused much damage to the plantations. Diego Colon acknowledged in a letter to the Spanish Crown that if the revolt had not been quelled quickly it would have claimed many Christian lives.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAlthough defeated, the rebellion had instilled tremendous fear in the Spanish colonists and they took measures to guard themselves from the people who were most involved in the uprising. On May 11, 1526, Spain passed the first measure in a series of anti-Muslim and anti-Wolof legislation. A royal decree forbade the introduction of "Gelofes," as they were often called, of Negroes from the Levant, of black people who had been raised with the Moors, and of people from Guinea. Six years later, another decree was issued that made reference to uprisings having resulted in the deaths of several Christians and stressed the danger still posed by the Wolof, who had also rebelled in San Juan , Puerto Rico, in Santa Maria, Colombia, and in Panama. The decree described them as "arrogant, disobedient, rebellious, and incorrigible." Despite the threat they represented, they continued to be introduced; and their tendency to revolt did not weaken. By the 1540s, Wolof maroons had formed their own cavalry with stolen horses, and they raided the plantations of Hispaniola. They went "always on horses" and proved to be "skilled and audacious, both in the charge and the use of the\r\nlance" as was mentioned in a letter sent on June 28, 1546, to the Spanish king.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n<font class="caption"><i>Pictured</i>, a Sengalese warrior from the 1780s</font>\r\n</p>\r\n	1522	1526	7	87	Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion, Volume 1  edited by Junius P.

26	Lemba!	<p class="entry columns" style="-webkit-column-gap: 210px; /* Chrome, Safari, Opera */\r\n    -moz-column-gap: 210px; /* Firefox */\r\n    column-gap: 210px;">\r\n&emsp;Sebastian Lemba (d. 1547) is the most famous rebel African slave leader in Hispaniola's long history, for he was the very first that we know by name. He was "an extraordinarily cunning Negro and very knowledgeable about things of war, whom all obey and all fear." Lemba, who was probably from the Kongo, appears to have become a <i>cimarron</i> (runaway) sometime in the the 1520s or early 1530s. He probably had been a slave on one of the island's many cane sugar ingenios, for this was the era when the first commercial cane sugar industry in the "New World" was on the rise, and Spaniards were clamoring to bring in more and more African slave laborers. "Lemba" was a kind of spiritual association of wealthy merchants&#8212;a mix perhaps of a church and the Rotary club&#8212;based in Kongo. Lemba's name hints thai he was a businessman caught in an Imbangala slave raid. If so, his organizational skills may have played a role in his leadership, which the Spaniards admitted was "extremely able.”\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nLemba and his men (up to four hundred were reported) were among the many African cimarrones who joined the rebellion of the\r\nTaino cacique Enriquillo from 1519 to 1534. Although Enriquillo finally negotiated a peace treaty with the Spanish crown for himself and his people, Lemba refused to accept the terms and refused to stop rebelling against the Spaniards.  Lemba and his men pillaged and attacked the Spaniards of Hispaniola and their allies, including Enriquillo's men, who had accepted the crown's terms.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nFar more vengeful than Enriquillo had been, Lemba broke his troops into small, mobile bands that pillaged sugar plantations and mills for sixteen years. So many slaves were inspired to revolt by his actions that the archdeacon of Santo Domingo claimed in 1541 that the number of guerrillas in the hills was greater than the number of Spaniards in Hispaniola. Only ten of Hispaniola's thirty-four\r\nsugar mills were open; the rest had been shut down by rebel slaves.  \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nFive years after the archdeacon's lament, Lemba was stabbed with a lance in September of 1547 by an African slave who was part of a Spanish patrol led by Captain Villalpando&#8212;that slave's reward was his liberty. Lemba's head was taken back to Santo Domingo and set upon a pike at the main gate leading to the wharves along me the Rio Ozama as a warning to others not to rebel. It did not work. The colonial government had utterly lost control. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nWithin months of Lemba's death its officials were complaining to the court that rebels were “killing and robbing Spaniards” just nine miles outside of Santo Domingo: there was a huge rebellion on an ingenio in La Vega (perhaps incited by some of Lemba's own men who had escaped the Spanish patrol), and other African slave captains such as Dieguillo de Ocampo and Juan Vaquero remained on the loose, causing havoc across the island. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nNot that this caused them to rethink their commitment to slavery: the same letter asked the king for permission to ship five to six thousand more slaves to open more sugar plantations.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe Spanish crown never managed to raze the whole community of insurgent Maroons.</p>	1532	1547	7	38	Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion,<br>edited by Junius P.

32	<span style="font-size:2.4em;">Subversive Dances</span>	<p class="entry columns" style="font-size:1.05em;"><i>In 1579, a native called Obera, who had been educated by a Catholic priest, led a movement within the context of Guarani resistance. He called himself the liberator of his people and incited his followers to subversive dances that would bring about the downfall of the Western system.</i>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Guarani labored with their Spanish kin as new iron tools improved productivity and Spanish power overawed enemies. After a few\r\nyears, however, the Guarani discovered that Spaniards no longer reciprocated, as aboriginal traditions required. The Guarani were considered not equal but inferior to Europeans. So the Guarani stopped working.\r\n<br>\r\nTheir resistance escalated into uncoordinated, abortive rebellions in 1539, 1542 or 1543, 1546, and several between 1556 and 1580. In 1546 Guarani males protested their loss of women to the Spaniards and revealed their dislike of infant mestizos, later the basis of ethnic Paraguayans. The mestizo preference for the world of their Spanish fathers was an unforgivable insult. The absence of children in Guarani villages had disrupted normal patterns. Insufficient children remained to work, support the kinship system, and carry on traditional life. "The uprising of Obera in the Guarambare region in 1579 . . . can be considered as a paradigm of the many Guarani liberation movements." Known mainly through the poem of Archdeacon Martin Barco de Centenera, who served on the punitive expedition to suppress Guayraca, heir to the legacy of resistance, Obera (also written as Overa) was a baptized Guarani. He had experienced the oppression of the encomienda, and he resisted. Pulling Christian doctrine into the framework of Guarani oratory, Obera became a leader of Guarani liberation. "He called himself a true son of God, born of a virgin, incarnated for the liberation of his people." He named his son Guyraro as his pope, but his movement failed.\r\n</p>	1579	1579	2	60	THE CAMBRIDGE HISTORY OF THE NATIVE PEOPLES OF THE AMERICAS.

The monarch added that Indians were bought and sold; that they slept in the open air; and that mothers killed their children to save them from the torture of the mines. Yet the Crown's hypocrisy had smaller limits than the empire: it received a fifth of the value of the metals extracted by its subjects in all of the Spanish New World, as well as other taxes, and the Portuguese Crown was to have the same arrangement in eighteenth-century Brazil. Latin American silver and gold—as Engels put it—penetrated like a corrosive acid through all the pores of Europe's moribund feudal society, and, for the benefit of nascent mercantilist capitalism, the mining entrepreneurs turned Indians and black slaves into a teeming &quot;external proletariat&quot; of the European economy. Greco-Roman slavery was revived in a different world; to the plight of the Indians of the exterminated Latin American civilizations was added the ghastly fate of the blacks seized from African villages to toil in Brazil and the Antilles. The colonial Latin American economy enjoyed the most highly concentrated labor fore known until that time, making possible the greatest concentration of wealth ever enjoyed by any civilization in world history.<br>\r\n  \r\nThe price of the tide of avarice, terror, and ferocity bearing down on these regions was Indian genocide: the best recent investigations credit pre-Columbian Mexico with a population between 30 and 37.5 million, and the Andean region is estimated to have possessed a similar number; Central America had between 10 and 13 million. The Indians of the Americas totaled no less than 70 million when the foreign conquerors appeared on the horizon; a century and a half later they had been reduced to 3.5 million. In 1685 only 4,000 Indian families remained of the more than 2 million that had once lived between Lima and Paita, according to the Marquis of Barinas.

36	Palmares, a community of escaped slaves	<p class="entry" style="background:white;padding:5px 10px; width:500px;">Palmares, which will eventually become the largest Quilombo, <i>community of escaped slaves</i>, in Brazil is founded; the community lasts until 1694. \r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="background:white;padding:5px 10px; width:700px;">\r\nIn Brazil, a little before the Djuka exodus, fugitive slaves had organized the black kingdom of Palmares in the Northeast, and throughout the eighteenth century had successfully resisted dozens of military expeditions sent to\r\nsuppress them, first by the Dutch and then by the Portuguese. Assaults by thousands of soldiers were fruitless against the guerrilla tactics which, until 1693, made the refuge invulnerable. The independent kingdom of Palmares&#8212;a call to rebellion, a banner of liberty&#8212;was organized as a state, similar to the many that existed in Africa in the seventeenth century. It extended from near Cape Santo Agostinho in Pernambuco to the northern Rio Sao Francisco zone in Alagoas, an area one-third the size of Portugal and surrounded by dense, wild forests. The ruling chief was elected from among the wisest and most skillful: the man, of greatest prestige and success in war or command. When the sugar plantation was at its height of omnipotence, Palmares was the one corner of Brazil where agriculture was being diversified. Guided by their own experience or that of their ancestors in African savannas and forests, the blacks raised corn, sweet potatoes, beans, manioc, bananas, and other foods. The colonial troops, assigned to bring back the men who had crossed the sea in chains and deserted the plantations, believed&#8212;and not without reason&#8212;that the destruction of these crops was their main purpose.\r\n<br>\r\nThe abundance of food in Palmares contrasted with its lack in coastal areas at the zenith of the sugar prosperity. The slaves who had won liberty defended it ably and bravely because they shared its fruits: land in the black state was held in common and no money circulated. No slave rebellion in world history lasted as long as that in Palmares: Spartacus's rebellion, which shook the most important slave system of ancient times, lasted eighteen months. For the final onslaught the Portuguese Crown mobilized the biggest army seen in Brazil until the colony became independent much later. No fewer than 10,000 people defended the last bastion of Palmares; the survivors were beheaded, thrown from precipices, or sold to merchants in Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires. Two years later the chief Zumbi, whom the slaves believed to be immortal, was betrayed and captured. He was surrounded in the forest and his head cut off. And rebellions continued. Not long afterward Captain Bartolomeu Bueno do Prado returned from the Rio das Mortes with trophies of victory over another slave rising. He brought 3,900 pairs of ears in his horses' saddlebags.\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	1600	1694	6	15	Open Veins of Latin America, Eduardo Galeano	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.45655	2015-02-13 04:07:47.45655	\N

It gave the United States a way to control Cuba without running it directly, by maintaining a submissive local regime. Washington would go on to apply this system, with clever variations attuned to local circumstances, in many parts of the Caribbean and Central America, where to this day it is known as <i>plattismo</i>.  Most of those semicolonial relationships remained operative for decades until the 1930s Good Neighbor policy modified or ended them. Most were used as well to legitimize periodic American interventions, often multiple ones such as the three in Cuba in 1906, 1912, and 1917, and often long-term ones such as the nineteen-year occupation of Haiti. Before 1917, some used an alleged German strategic threat as justification, but interventions continued apace after World War I simply substituting implicitly race-based rationales such as the paternalistic “Moral Uplift” program in Haiti.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Veto"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="font-size:1.05em;background-color:white;width:500px; padding:10px;">\r\n\r\nUnder the Platt Amendment as written by the U.S. Secretary of War, the United States agreed to end its occupation of Cuba as soon as the Cubans accepted a constitution with provisions giving the United States the right to veto any treaty between Cuba and any other country; the right to supervise the Cuban treasury; and "the right to intervene for the preservation of Cuban independence [or] the maintenance of a government adequate for the protection of life, property and individual liberty; the right to maintain military bases in Cuba (Under the last provision, the United States established its base at Guantánamo Bay, which it retains to this day over Cuban protests). Additionally, title IV ratified and validated “all acts of the United States in Cuba during its military occupancy.” The latter provision was quite important because while occupying Cuba, U.S. military authorities had given concessions to U.S. enterprises in various fields, particularly public utilities. Title IV ensured that none of those concessions would be altered or declared invalid by any future Cuban government. The Platt Amendment was not only insulting but also onerous to the people of Cuba, because under it they would have to pay not only for U.S. military expeditions, but also for occupations and their concomitant bureaucracy.\r\nIn essence, the Platt Amendment gave Cubans permission to rule themselves as long as they allowed the United States to veto any decision they made.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Reneging"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:1.05em;background-color:white;width:850px; padding:10px;">\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers of Congress could not avoid realizing that by passing the Platt Amendment, they would be reneging on the pledge they had made to Cuba less than three years before. Each had to ask himself a painful question that the <i>New York Evening Post</i> framed in a pithy editorial: "Given a solemn and unmistakable promise of independence to Cuba, how can I lie out of it and still go to church to thank God that I am not as other men are?" Senators resolved this dilemma without evident difficulty. On February 27, 1901, they approved the Platt Amendment by a vote of forty-three to twenty. Republicans cast all the affirmative votes. Later the House of Representatives joined in approval, also on a party-line vote. President McKinley signed the amendment into law on March 2. That plunged Cuba into what one historian called "a storm of excitement." \r\n<span class="blockquote" style="font-style:italic;">\r\nHavana was in turmoil on the night of March 2. A torchlight procession delivered a petition of protest to Wood at the Governor's Palace, and another crowd of demonstrators sought out the convention delegates and urged them to stand firm in their opposition to American demands. Similar demonstrations occurred on the following night. Outside the capital, municipal governments throughout the island poured out a flood of protest messages and resolutions, while public meetings were epidemic. \r\nOn the night of March 5, speakers told a procession in Santiago that if the United States held to its demands, the Cubans must go to war once more. </span>\r\n\r\nBoth Cuban anarchist papers <i>¡Tierra!</i> and <i>El Nuevo Ideal</i> published energetic protests against the Amendment. Cuban delegates to the constitutional convention had to decide whether to accept the Platt Amendment. American officials assured them that the United States wished no direct influence over Cuba's internal affairs, and also warned them that if they did not accept the Platt Amendment, Congress would impose even harsher terms. After long debate, much of it conducted behind closed doors, the Cuban delegates agreed, by a vote of fifteen to fourteen, to do what the United States wished. A year later, in an election the Americans supervised, Tomas Estrada Palma, who had lived for years in the town of Central Valley, New York, was chosen as the first president of the Republic of Cuba. General Wood, the military governor, wrote in a private letter what every sentient Cuban and American knew: <span style="color:#cc0000;">"There is, of course, little or no independence left Cuba under the Platt Amendment."</span>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Domination"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="font-size:1.05em;background-color:white;width:500px; padding:10px;">\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Navy established GTMO in eastern Cuba (Oriente), more than six hundred miles from Havana. Underdeveloped by the Spanish colonial regime and in close proximity to Jamaica and Haiti, eastern Cuba’s economy was quite limited at the turn of the century. After 1898, U.S. financial interests invested heavily in Oriente. For example, in 1902 Cuba’s eastern provinces produced only\r\n15 percent of the island’s sugar; by 1924 the proportion had increased to 54 percent, and by 1929 it was 69.5 percent. American-owned sugar companies, including the Cuban American Sugar Company, the UFC, and the Guantánamo Sugar Company, dominated Oriente’s economic landscape. United Fruit Company towns such as Banes and Preston existed largely\r\noutside Cuban law as quasi-independent enclaves within eastern Cuba.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThe situation essentially represented de facto if not fully de jure colonialism. For more than three decades, U.S. economic and political control of the island republic was quite open and was often reinforced by actual or threatened military intervention. Foreign domination, in combination with the native class system, produced a political system dominated by two almost indistinguishable political parties, the Conservatives and Liberals, who alternated in office under the leadership of their usually corrupt chieftains. Cuban politicians accommodated themselves to the internal and external status quo, and some had direct ties to U.S. business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>In 1934, the Platt Amendment was officially abolished, although United States retains in perpetuity a naval base in Guantánamo Bay.\r\n</p>	1902	1902	1	32	Overthrow by Stephen Kinzer, A History of the Cuban Revolution by Aviva Chomsky, Colonial Crucible edited by McCoy and Scarano, Cuban Anarchism: The History of A Movement by Frank Fernández	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.489944	2015-02-13 04:07:47.489944	\N
226	A Plan, A Canal, Panama	<p class="entry bigquote"style="width:600px;font-size:120%"><strong>1903</strong> US forces plan and assist Conservative independence revolt for Panama, ensuring successful break from republic of Colombia. The US later &quot;negotiates&quot; a treaty with the newly formed Republic of Panama, thereby assuming control of the Panama Canal Zone.\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the United States obtained control over the unﬁnished canal works in Panama in 1903, through naval and diplomatic intimidation, it established army forts in the area.  Both the canal construction workforce and U.S. soldiers would live in Panama and have to grapple with tropical diseases that had overcome the French effort to dig a canal. The chosen method was through military control of potential vectors of malaria and yellow fever, thus reinforcing the rationale for and control exercised by the foreign military presence. The army was also entrusted with overseeing the construction and management of the canal itself from 1907 until the very end of the U.S. tenure in 1999.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="padding:10px;position:relative;top:-10px;">\r\nThe existence of a complex of military bases in the Panama Canal area, including extensive tropical lands, and the clientelistic relationship between the U.S. and Panamanian states made the isthmus a convenient place to locate activities to help project U.S. power throughout the hemisphere and the Paciﬁc. Bases in Panama and Puerto Rico \r\nprovided convenient platforms from which to launch interventions in Central American and Caribbean nations, which the United States did frequently from 1900 to 1933. Though limited in scale, especially by today’s standards, the military interventions were always sufficient to determine the outcome of local conflicts, usually so as to favor U.S. commercial interests.  During World War II, the United States maintained as many as 63,000 troops in Panama and forced through an agreement to establish more than 100 military bases outside the Canal Zone in the interior of Panama, ostensibly to defend the canal.<br>\r\nDuring the Cold War, United States military doctrine for Latin America and the Caribbean focused on increasing the capacity of national militaries for “internal defense,” i.e. combating forces within Latin American countries that challenged the existing order. The doctrine frequently did not distinguish between armed insurgency and peaceful agitation, or even civic opposition. Fort Gulick in Panama became host to a U.S. Army facility known as the School of the Americas, which trained 29,000 Latin American troops between 1949 and 1984, when the school was moved to Georgia. The air force and navy trained thousands of Latin American soldiers at other facilities in Panama. But the United States also trained and tested for its own military adventures, especially in Southeast Asia. The ﬁring ranges and sites in Panama provided the central location for testing weapons (missiles, nerve agents, depleted uranium) and other military equipment under tropical conditions. A jungle operations training center on Fort Sherman in Panama was a key location for training infantry bound for Vietnam.\r\n</p>	1903	1903	1	103	U.S. MILITARY BASES IN LATIN  AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN John Lindsay-Poland	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.498264	2015-02-13 04:07:47.498264	\N

68	The British, Honduras, the British Honduras, and Contraband 	<div class="page" data-title="Trujillo"></div>\r\n<p class="columns">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/piratesafehavens.gif" style="float:left;padding:10px;"><span class="caption">Pirate Safe Havens of the Western Caribbean, 17<sup>th</sup> Century</span>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>British establish the colony of Honduras, now known as Belize. Let's look at the neighborhood:</i>\r\n\r\nThe informal English settlements in Central America became important smuggling centers, especially in the eighteenth century. The Treaty of Madrid of 1670 recognized all lands then currently occupied by the English in North America and the West Indies as their possessions  and the English later claimed that the Treaty included the settlements in Belize and the Mosquito Coast, a claim the Spanish never recognized. The English had begun to trade with the Miskito Indians at Cabo de Gracias a Dios at least by 1633, beginning the English-Miskito alliance. As the Industrial Revolution began, the demand in Britain for indigo dye from Central America increased, especially after the general expansion of the world economy in the 1730s. The British settlement at Black River on the Mosquito Shore became a major center from which to conduct illegal trade with the Spanish during the 1700s. Several smaller British settlements on the Mosquito Shore also served as trading sites, but mostly with the Zambos Mosquitos, the loyal allies of the British, without whose protection and allegiance the trade would have been impossible to carry out.\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the eighteenth century, Trujillo was well situated for the increasing smuggling activity along the Caribbean coast. Founded in 1525, Trujillo served as a port to ship gold from the interior to Spain. The gold hinterland lasted until around 1550, by which time most of the easily removed gold had been mined and the indigenous labor had declined drastically. Sarsaparilla and cattle hides replaced gold as the major export items throughout the next eight decades, but even though large amounts were shipped out from Trujillo they failed to bring riches to the city. In the 1630s and 1640s, both Dutch and English pirates repeatedly attacked Trujillo, with Spain nearly powerless to stop such attacks. The city's decline began shortly afterwards, and the 1683 census reported the city as completely abandoned. The people of the town had moved inland to the Aguán Valley to escape pirate attacks and had established their own, unauthorized settlements, with many living in homesteads quite a distance from each other, much to the dismay of the province's officials. Although officially abandoned, Trujillo soon became a busy contraband entrepôt.\r\n<br>\r\nAs early as 1718, Spanish citizens met British traders at Trujillo, and contraband activity began increasing through the 1720s. By 1737, the anchorage called Puerto Nuevo or Puerto Escondido, at the end of the spit that forms the bay where the modem port of Puerto Castilla is located, was in regular use by British ships because of the refuge the site afforded from the rough, open seas. During this period, the frontier between the Spanish and the British/Zambos-Mosquitos ran through Trujillo Bay, the lower Aguán Valley, and the Agalta Valley, continuing with the general frontier between the Spanish settlements and indigenous settlements in western Olancho. At Trujillo, British goods were unloaded from ships and placed directly on mules that carried them to the interior.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="The Contraband"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/contrabandhinterland.gif" style="float:left;padding:10px;"><span class="caption">Contraband Hinterland of Trujillo, 1720s to 1780s</span>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people of Sonaguera supplied mules, horses, hides, and a large number of cattle for the contraband trade. Sarsaparilla was another major product for smuggling that came from the Aguán Valley, mostly from the lower and wetter sections. The residents of Sonaguera also sold food, including plantains and chickens, to passing ships that stopped in Trujillo Bay. Illegally imported goods found in the Aguán Valley included cloth, clothing, food, spices, and other miscellaneous products. Cattle from Yoro was traded at Trujillo for British clothing.\r\n<br>\r\nSpanish officials knew that the contraband trade with the Olancho Valley through Trujillo was enormous. Illegally obtained foreign goods were openly traded in Olancho el Viejo. Cattle from Olancho traveled by way of the road opened by the British to Trujillo. Silver was an important trade item from Olancho to the British, through Trujillo. In Juticalpa, investigators discovered eighteen cargas of textiles and clothing from England. The primary documents have few details on the types of items and the amounts that were smuggled, but all indicate that there was substantial illegal trade through the Olancho Valley connected through Trujillo. Indigo, silver, gold, sarsaparilla, and other goods came from Tegucigalpa, the major portion of the trade, and Mineral de los Cedros. From Comayagua came salt, cacao, necklaces, hammocks, tallow, lard, and deer hides. Illegal British good, plentiful in both Comayagua and Tegucigalpa, often were sold in the open. During Semana Santa in 1745, the wife of the governor of Honduras received a ring from a contrabandista who was trading openly in Comayagua.\r\n<br>\r\nThe contraband hinterland for Trujillo extended even to Nicaragua and El Salvador. Cacao and maize are specifically mentioned as products brought from the city of Leon to the port. Indigo, however, was the main trade item, coming largely from El Salvador. Mule trains carrying indigo were said to pass continuously and in public view from San Miguel along both the major routes to Trujillo. People from San Miguel traveled to Black River and traded indigo for British textiles. In Nicaragua and San Salvador British goods sold openly, often coming from Trujillo.\r\n</p>	1720	1720	1	12	Contraband Trade Through Trujillo, Honduras, 1720s-1782  Taylor E.

39	A Warning to Others	<p class="entry columns" style="color:white;">\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/mexicociudadahorca.jpg">\r\n<br>\r\n<span class="caption" style="color:white;">The gallows and pillory opposite the Houses of Cabildo. La Picota, 1650. </span>\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;On May 2, 1612, thirty-five blacks were publicly hanged in the main plaza of Mexico City before a large crowd. The condemned, including seven women, had been sentenced to death for plotting an uprising of black slaves to overthrow the racial and political control of the Spanish in Mexico. The Audiencia (royal court of Mexico) ordered that twenty-nine of the bodies be decapitated, with the heads left atop the gallows, while the remaining six bodies were to be quartered and displayed throughout the city as a warning to blacks throughout Mexico&#8212;both slave and free&#8212;not to challenge Spanish power. Twelve days later another black man was executed, while Spanish authorities sent several others implicated in the plot to Spain to testify before the king. The bodies of the condemned rotted in the streets until physicians in the city warned that their stench and decomposition had created a public health hazard.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe few accounts of the Mexico City Plot of 1612 that survive come mainly from Spanish sources, making it uncertain whether a conspiracy did in fact take place. Most reports, however, asserted that a group of blacks in Mexico City, angry at their continued abuse at the hands of the Spanish, decided to overthrow and murder the white population of the city. Once in control, the rebels supposedly hoped to crown a black king and queen of Mexico, execute all male Spaniards, and take the remaining female Spaniards as their concubines. The original plan called for the uprising to commence during the 1611 Christmas celebrations, when most whites would be distracted by religious activities, but was postponed because of the arrival of several Spanish military units in the city on the eve of the revolt. Rescheduled for Holy Thursday during the celebration of Lent, when whites would again be distracted by religious duties, rumors of the uprising began to swirl around the city, and Spanish authorities received several warnings (usually from people claiming to have overheard the plotting) as the date approached. Acting swiftly, the Audiencia immediately cracked down on the black community in Mexico City, rounding up local leaders who, under torture, explicated the plan and implicated others. When several caches of arms surfaced, the Audiencia sentenced the conspirators to death.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe harsh reaction of Spanish officials came, in part, because of their earlier experiences with uprisings among Mexico's sizable black population. A near-revolt had been avoided in 1608 and a large demonstration of fifteen hundred blacks in Mexico City in 1611, sparked by outrage over the flogging death of a female slave, had the white population of the city on edge. While the executions of those implicated in the 1612 plot were certainly an effort to discourage future revolts among the slave and free black populations of Mexico, it was also an effort by the authorities to demonstrate to whites in Mexico that the Spanish crown could indeed protect them from such uprisings. Accordingly, Spanish officials immediately issued new restrictions on black Mexicans limiting their movement, outlawing black organizations, and banning the sale of weapons to blacks.\r\n</p>	1612	1612	1	53	<span style="color:white;">Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion, Volume 1  edited by Junius P.

34	Overwhelming	<p class="entry columns" style="background-color:white;margin-top:340px;padding:7px;">\r\n&emsp;In Chile, Mapuche resistance to the imperial church was overwhelming. Their rebellions against white invaders resounded with protests against the Church. During the uprising of 1598 the natives &quot;profaned&quot; more than fifty churches or chapels and renounced their christian names. Mapuche peasant materialism was a wall of contention raised against Catholic eschatology: the former owners of the land of Chile did not accept the doctrine of hell and imagined a heaven full of earthly delights.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n&emsp;The Mapuches (Araucanians) triumphed as no other indigenous peoples due to their political organization and war pacts\r\nmodeled on the Polynesian toki. The matrilineal but polygamous Mapuche clans in war time elected a\r\nleader from among its most valiant, strong, and intelligent individuals.\r\nLike the Roman dictatorship, this institution permitted concerted action\r\nin warfare. Afterward, the toki (military chief) returned to his earlier\r\nactivities, and the chiefs resumed governance of their clan. Thus, a military\r\ninstitution original to the Polynesians and wielded by the Mapuches impeded the Spaniards during the entire colonial epoch from ever conquering southern Chile.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;<a data-entry="24" data-year="1540" class="inline">Lautaro</a>, son of Curiñancu, and Caupolicán, who defeated the conquistadores, excelled among the\r\nMapuches, who impeded European and criollo occupation of southern\r\nChile until the nineteenth century.

Velasco was concerned that Mexico already had too many Africans&#8212;and he feared what they might do\r\nif they were organized. It turned out he had good reason. \r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nBetween 1570 and 1609, a slave named Gasper Yanga escaped and led a group of his fellow Africans to freedom in the mountains located in the vicinity of Pico de Orizaba (Citlaltepetl, or &quot;star mountain&quot;, the highest mountain in Mexico), the Cofre de Perote, Zongolica and Olmec regions. By 1600, it is reported that the Yanga maroon settlement, or palenques, was joined by Francisco de la Matosa and his group of African maroons. \r\n Not only did he escape slavery fifty years before the Mayflower landed on Plymouth Rock, but he launched guerrilla attacks on the Spanish, tormenting them from the mountains for three decades. The Spanish could never catch him, never put him back in bondage.\r\nAll of this occurred before the independence of Mexico from the Spanish crown. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nYanga's early palenques would turn into decades-long resistance against colonial Spain. In 1609, Spain's viceroy of New Spain (the colonial name of Mexico) was Luis de Velasco, Marquis of Salinas. That year, Velasco sent Captain Pedro Gonzalez on a military expedition against the Yanga palenques. The battle came to a head at the Rio Blanco and resulted in major losses on both sides. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nBy 1631, viceroy of New Spain Rodrigo Pacheco began negotiations with the Gaspar Yanga resistance. Yanga struck an agreement with the colonial leader respecting Spain's recognition of an autonomous region for the African community. The first official name was San Lorenzo de los Negros (aka San Lorenzo de Cerralvo), near Cordova. Since 1932, the Mexican town has bore the name of its liberator Gasper Yanga. \r\n\r\n</p>	1609	1609	6	95	Black in Latin America By Henry Louis Gates	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.580989	2015-02-13 04:07:47.580989	\N
37	The King's "protection" of the Indigenous (and the encomienda)	<p class="entry columns" style="height:190px;">While metals flowed unceasingly from Latin American mines, equally unceasing were the orders from the Spanish Court granting paper protection and dignity to the Indians whose killing labor sustained the kingdom. The fiction of legality protected the Indian; the reality of exploitation drained the blood from his body. From slavery to the encomienda of service, and from this to the encomienda of tribute and the regime of wages, variants in the Indian labor force's juridical condition made only superficial changes in the real situation. \r\n<img src="/mapimages/kingphilipiii.jpg" style="float:right; padding: 0px 10px">\r\n\r\nThe Crown regarded the inhuman exploitation of Indian labor as so necessary that in 1601 Philip III, banning forced labor in the mines by decree, at the same time sent secret instructions ordering its continuation &quot;in case that measure should reduce production.&quot;</p>	1601	1601	5	42	Open Veins of Latin America, Galeano	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.588912	2015-02-13 04:07:47.588912	\N
42	Almost Depopulated of Spaniards	<div style="padding:9px 15px;position:relative;top:0px;left:-10px;background-color: rgba(255,255,255,.5);width:465px;">\r\n<p class="entry" style="padding:0;margin:0;opacity:1;">\r\nOn the night of November 16, 1616, the Tepehuan rose in rebellion, taking the Spaniards completely by surprise. Entering Atotonilco, the Indians killed ten missionaries and 200 civilians. That same night they surrounded to Santiago Papasquiaro, where the Christians resisted 17 days. The Tepehuanes Indians had limited success in trying to enlist the aid of the Conchos Indians who lived around the Parras mission, on the northern edge of the Tepehuan territory. On the other hand, they had considerable success in getting the Acaxees and Xiximes to attack Spanish mines and settlements in western Nueva Vizcaya. However, when the Tepehuanes advanced on the recently converted Acaxee pueblos of Tecucuoapa and Carantapa, the 130 Acaxee warriors decided to side with the Spaniards and decisively defeated their Tepehuan neighbors. Because the loyalties of the Acaxees and Xiximes were divided, the Spaniards were able to extinguish their uprising more rapidly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="entry" style="padding:0;margin:0;margin-top:10px;opacity:1;">\r\nNative allies of the Spaniards were crucial in mounting an effective defense against the Tepehuanes and in putting down the revolt. On December 19, Captain Gaspar de Alvear led a force of sixty-seven armed cavalry and 120 Concho allies into the war zone to confront the insurgents. The hostilities continued until 1620 and laid waste to a large area. When Mateo de Vesga became Governor of Nueva Vizcaya in 1618, he described the province as &quot;destroyed and devastated, almost depopulated of Spaniards.&quot; By the end of the revolt, at least a thousand allied Indians had died, while the Tepehuanes may have lost as many as 4,000 warriors. Professor Spicer regards the Tepehuan revolt as &quot;one of the three bloodiest and most destructive Indian attempts to throw off Spanish control in northwestern New Spain.&quot; Following the revolt, the Tepehuanes fled to mountain retreats to escape Spanish vengeance. Not until 1723 would the Jesuits return to work among them.</p>\r\n</div>	1616	1620	2	96	THE HISTORY OF INDIGENOUS DURANGO John P.

48	<span style="font-size:2em;">The St. Kitts Slave Revolt</span>	<p class="entry" style="background-color:white;padding:7px;position:absolute;top: 50px; width: 290px;">\r\nOn the island St. Kitts, in November 1639, more than sixty enslaved Africans from the Capisterre region, angered by the brutal treatment meted out to them by their owners, left their plantations and found refuge on the slopes of Mount Misery. The runaways built a formidable camp upon the mountainside. It was protected by a precipice on one side and could only be approached by a narrow pass. From this position they carried out raids on the plantations.\r\n<br>\r\nTo put an end to their activities, Governor De Poincy raised a company of five hundred armed men. The stronghold was stormed by the soldiers and the uprising was crushed without much difficulty as the runaways were poorly armed and too few in number to offer much resistance. Most of them were killed in skirmishes. Some of the runaways were burnt alive, while the rest were captured, quartered, and their limbs exposed on stakes to serve as a warning to those who might be tempted to rebel. However, one of their leaders, a gigantic man, escaped and continued to elude capture for three years and was able to carry on a one-man reign of terror from the forests of Mount Misery. He served as a rallying point for other discontented enslaved Africans and was kept well \r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entry" style="background-color:white;padding:7px;position:absolute;top: 50px; right:20px;width: 290px;">\r\ninformed of what was going on in the settlements.\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he continued to live apart from his fellow runaways, fearing that one of them might betray him in order to gain favour with the planters. His success in evading capture inspired many to think that he was aided by supernatural powers. Realising the danger that this situation caused to the French settlement on the island, De Poincy sent some half a dozen soldiers to track him down and capture him. The mission was kept secret to prevent the slaves from giving him advance notice of what was to come. The soldiers pursued him and once they had him in their sights they blazed away at him. None of their muskets would go off and the infuriated African sword in hand, charged them. The men fled and he was able to gain a musket and a hat. Again the rumor spread that the runaway possessed magical powers that protected him from fire arms.\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly the French Governor sent out another squad to seize him. Again the African was found and surrounded, again shots were fired and again he was not hit. However, the sergeant who must have kept his nerve more than his subordinates, shot him through the head. His body was quartered and the limbs hung in the most public places.\r\n\r\n</p>	1639	1639	7	70		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.644384	2015-02-13 04:07:47.644384	\N

An Irish Footnote</strong>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nBetween 1641 and 1653 Ireland suffered a demographic collapse of staggering proportions. Over a quarter of the population perished as a result of endemic warfare, famine and disease, including the last major outbreak of plague in the country. The architect of the English reconquest of the island, Oliver Cromwell, described Ireland as ‘a clean paper’, which, following the victory of the New Model Army, could be remodelled in the interests of the Westminster parliament. The Act of Settlement, passed in August 1652, outlined in detail the fate of the country and its inhabitants. The preamble reassured the general populace that the parliamentary regime did not intend ‘to extirpate the whole nation’, offering instead to extend mercy to ‘the inferior sort’, as long as they lived peacefully under the colonial government. The act contained a number of clauses, specifically excluding certain groups and named individuals from the general pardon. \r\n<br>\r\nPredictably, the first clause condemned those accused of killing Protestant settlers at the outbreak of the rebellion in 1641. The parliamentarians defined ‘involve-ment’ in the broadest possible sense to include not only those actively ‘bearing arms’ but also any person who assisted the rebels in any way. Technically, at least, this covered the vast bulk of the Catholic population. The second clause excluded all Catholic clergy from pardon, and hundreds were subsequently killed or banished overseas. The next clause listed over 100 named individuals, mostly prominent Catholic political and military leaders, some of whom had already departed for the Continent. All of them forfeited their extensive estates, and the colonial authorities in Dublin reserved the right to move any individual to another part of the country if deemed necessary for reasons of ‘public safety’. \r\n<br>\r\nDespite the potentially all-encompassing nature of the exclusion clauses, the Act of Settlement was primarily concerned with dispossessing Catholic landowners, thus enabling the parliamentary regime to repay its supporters, both soldiers and financiers, with confiscated land. During the remainder of the 1650s, the government transplanted over 40,000 people across the River Shannon into Connacht, where they could be effectively corralled and controlled. The common soldiers and ‘inferior sort’ provided a lucrative source of revenue for merchants with shipping at their disposal. As the war drew to a close, the parliamentarians, anxious to rid the country of hostile soldiers, licensed military entrepreneurs to transport large numbers into Spanish service. From 1652, articles of surrender invariably contained specific terms enabling Catholic commanders to depart for the Continent with their men. Between 1651 and 1654, as many as 40,000 Irishmen sailed for the Continent, often on English merchant ships. Many of these exiles dreamed of returning home, but few ever did. \r\n<br>\r\nWhile the government encouraged enemy soldiers to leave the country, a different fate awaited those civilians unsuitable for military service. In the early decades of the seventeenth century, England acquired a number of islands in the Caribbean, such as Barbados and Montserrat, and began to develop lucrative tobacco and sugar plantations. African slaves provided most of the field labour, but a demand also existed for indentured servants of European stock, who worked for a fixed period of time, ‘under a yoke harsher than that of the Turks’, before eventually obtaining their freedom. From the 1630s, official accounts record the arrival of the Irish in the Caribbean, many of them kidnapped by press-gangs operating in the vicinity of the principal ports in Munster. The journey across the Atlantic took almost three months, and those who survived the crossing found living and working conditions on the plantations extremely harsh. After seven years of service, a handful did acquire small landholdings, but none that we know of ever returned to Ireland. \r\n<br>\r\nThe outbreak of the rebellion in 1641 temporarily disrupted the Atlantic trade, but transportations resumed after Cromwell’s invasion in August 1649. The first shipment occurred towards the end of that year, when, after the storming of Drogheda, Oliver Cromwell ordered the few surviving members of the garrison to be sent to Barbados. Over the coming years, thousands of military prisoners were sold in perpetuity to plantation-owners to work in the fields, effectively as slaves. Despite the departure of so many soldiers to the Continent at the end of the war, small Tory bands continued to pose a serious, if localised, military threat throughout the 1650s. Local parliamentary commanders usually executed captured Tories, or else arranged for them to be shipped to the Caribbean, along with those civilians accused of assisting them.\r\n<br>\r\nThe war had also created a large number of widows and orphans, many of them destitute and homeless. Over the next ten years, unscrupulous merchants shipped thousands of these Catholic women and children across the Atlantic. The authorities in Dublin, concerned by the ‘great multitudes of poor swarming in all parts of this nation’, welcomed this trade as a means of clearing the country of vagrants. They also periodically emptied the jails by sending shiploads of convicts to the colonies, a practice that continued until the late nineteenth century, with Australia replacing the West Indies as the principal destination. In 1655, as part of the war against Spain, an English fleet captured Jamaica. Shortly afterwards, the government in Ireland arranged for over 2,000 Catholic boys and girls to be transported there in an attempt to repopulate the island. \r\n<br>\r\nThe Irish did not always meekly accept their fate. In 1655, runaway Irish and African slaves in Barbados began attacking local militia forces, killing plantation-owners and destroying crops. It took the authorities the best part of two years to suppress the disorder. The island continued to be plagued by vagrant Irish, encouraging slaves to rebel against their masters. Some of the more adventurous managed to escape from English-controlled territory to the French colonies, such as the Leeward or Windward Islands, while others joined the numerous pirate fleets that roamed freely throughout the Caribbean for much of the seventeenth century. The collapse of the Cromwellian regime and the restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660 brought an end to large-scale transportations. Most of the Irish indentured servants had been freed by 1680, although shipments of convicted Tories continued throughout the reign of Charles II. Their descendants continue to reside in the Caribbean, particularly on the island of Montserrat, where Irish surnames such as O’Connor, Fitzgerald and O’Carroll are still to be found today.  \r\n<br>\r\n<i>Micheál Ó Siochrú’s God’s executioner: Oliver Cromwell and the conquest of Ireland will be published shortly by Faber.</i>\r\n</p>	1653	1653	5	84		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.701442	2015-02-13 04:07:47.701442	\N

Indians who had lived and worshiped independently for centuries were forced to abandon their religions, adopt Christianity, and pay tribute to Spanish rulers. Their traditional centers of worship (kivas) were destroyed along with the sacramental objects (kachinas) with which their ceremonies and devotions had always been performed. Resistance to Spanish rule was met with imprisonment, torture, and amputations.\r\n<br>\r\n&#8195;&#8195;\r\nAfter three generations of oppression, in the spring of 1680, the Pueblo Indians rose up to overthrow the Spanish. A religious leader from Taos Pueblo named Pope (sometimes found as Popay) secretly organized a widespread rebellion to occur throughout the region on a single day. Planning took shape silently during the summer of 1680 in more than 70 communities, from Santa Fe and Taos in the Rio Grande valley to the Hopi pueblos nearly 300 miles west. On the night of August 10, 1680, Indians in more than two dozen pueblos simultaneously attacked the Spanish authorities. A force of 2,500 Indian warriors sacked and burned the colonial headquarters in Santa Fe. By the time the revolt succeeded, Indian fighters had killed more than 400 Spanish soldiers and civilians (including two-thirds of the Catholic priests in the region) and had driven the surviving Europeans back to El Paso.\r\n<br>\r\n&#8195;&#8195;\r\nThe Indian leaders then restored their own religious institutions and set up a government that lasted until 1692. The Pueblo Revolt of 1680 was the single most successful act of resistance by Native Americans against a European invader. It established Indian independence in the pueblos for more than a decade, and even after Spanish domination was re-imposed it forced the imperial authorities to observe religious tolerance. Ever since the seventeenth century, the cross and the kiva have existed side by side in pueblo communities.</p>	1680	1692	2	53		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.729987	2015-02-13 04:07:47.729987	\N

59	The African Slaves	<p class="entry columns" style="column-fill:balance; height:540px;">The slaves spent their strength and their days in the gold-washing installations. &quot;There they work,&quot; wrote Luis Gomes Ferreira, a doctor who lived in Minas Gerais during the first half of the eighteenth century, &quot;there they eat, and often there they have to sleep; and since when they work they are bathed in sweat, with their feet always in the cold earth, on stones, or in water, when they rest or eat their pores close and they become so chilled that they are susceptible to many dangerous illnesses, such as very severe pleurisies, apoplectic and paralytic fits, convulsions, pneumonia, and many other diseases.&quot; The <i>capitaes do mato</i> of Minas Gerais collected rewards in gold for the severed heads of slaves who tried to escape. Disease was a blessing from heaven because it meant the approach of death.<br>\r\nThe slaves were called the &quot;coins of the Indies&quot; when they were measured, weighed and embarked in Luanda in the Portuguese colony of Angola; in Brazil those surviving the ocean voyage became &quot;the hands and feet&quot; of the white master. Angola exported Bantu slaves and elephant tusks in exchange for clothing, liquor, and firearms, but Ouro Preto miners preferred blacks shipped from the little beach of Ouidah on the Gulf of Guinea because they were more vigorous, lasted somewhat longer, and had the magic power to find gold. Every miner also needed a black mistress from Ouidah to bring him luck on his expeditions. (In Cuba, medicinal powers were attributed to female slaves. According to onetime slave Esteban Montejo, &quot;There was one type of sickness the whites picked up, a sickness of the veins and male organs. It could only be got rid of with black women; if the man who had it slept with a Negress he was cured immediately.&quot;) Ouro Preto's appetite for slaves became insatiable; they expired in short order, only in rare cases enduring the seven years of continuous labor. Yet the Portuguese were meticulous in baptizing them all before they crossed the Atlantic, and once in Brazil they were obliged to attend mass, although they were not allowed to sit in the pews or to enter the chanel.\r\n<br>\r\nThe gold explosion not only increased the importation of slaves, but absorbed a good part of the black labor from the sugar and tobacco plantations elsewhere in Brazil, leaving them without hands. The miners were contemptuous of farming, and in 1700 and 1713, in the full flush of prosperity, hunger stalked the region: millionaires had to eat cats, rats, ants, and birds of prey. A royal decree in 1711 banned the sale of slaves occupied in agriculture, with the exception of those who showed &quot;perversity of character.&quot;\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/middlepassageslavery.jpg" style="width:100%;break-after: always">\r\n<font class="caption">Scene in the hold of the "blood-stained Gloria".

71	The First Maroon War	<p class="entry" style="width:325px; padding:0px 15px;">\r\nThe First Maroon War erupts in Jamaica between the colonial government and the communities of runaway slaves known as maroons; unable to defeat the maroons, the British accepted a compromise treaty suggested by the maroon leader Cudjoe; the agreement allowed the maroons to live in five specified towns under their own chiefs and a British supervisor.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nOn March 1, 1738, the articles of pacification with the Maroons of Trelawny Town signaled to Jamaica that a new era was emerging. The English planters had feared the rising power of the Maroons, and therefore tried to subdue them. This proved to be unsuccessful, consequently causing the English to realize that making peace with the Maroons was the only possible solution. This treaty was the first of its kind and it demonstrated that a group of rebellious ex-slaves had forced a powerful class of planters to come to terms. This was an unlikely event during the eighteenth century, given the dominance of the planter class across the Caribbean. Yet the fact remains that the treaty did not solely serve the planters’ interest. For example, article three of the treaty states that the Maroons were given 1500 acres of crown land, a necessity for the Maroons to maintain their independent way of life. In addition, it made a boundary between the Maroons and the planters, which was to avoid future conflicts.\r\n<br>\r\n<i> Pictured, a British illustration of the agreement</i>\r\n</p>\r\n	1730	1739	6	50		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.848058	2015-02-13 04:07:47.848058	\N

The revolt was scheduled for October 11, the anniversary of the King's coronation; a grand ball was to have been given in honor of the occasion, and the Negroes planned to blow up the Governor's house, the explosion serving as the signal for a general massacre of the whites. The ball was deferred on account of the Governor's son, and the conspiracy was betrayed by an accomplice. The chief figures in the plot included three waiting men, thirteen carpenters, eight coopers, one coppersmith, one sugar boiler, two masons, one butcher, twenty-six drivers, three coachmen, one head field negro, one millwright, three fishermen, one wheelwright, one 'obeah man', and three fiddlers—some of the most trusted and valuable slaves. The leader, who called himself King Court, and his two generals, Tomboy and Hercules, were broken on the wheel (<i>Pictured</i>); so were three others. Six slaves were gibbeted, seventy-seven burned alive, and thirty-six banished.\r\n<br>\r\nA commission of inquiry stated that the admission of slaves into 'occupations truly proper only for freemen' was an underlying cause of the insurrection, and it recommended that slaves should be debarred from becoming tradesmen, overseers, drivers, distillers, shopkeepers, hawkers, peddlers, sailers, fiddlers for gain, or from keeping horses or working out for themselves. Tomboy had been a master mason who had been allowed by his master to take negro apprentices and make what profit he could out of his own and their labor. He paid his owner a fixed sum per month, and it was stated that the remainder of his earnings had been invested in the revolt. </p>\r\n\r\n	1736	1736	6	11		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.88126	2015-02-13 04:07:47.88126	\N

Britain declares war against Spain, beginning the War of Jenkins’ Ear (1739-1748). The war is caused by disputes between the two powers over the Florida boundary but chiefly by the British determination to secure commercial mastery in the Caribbean. The justification for war is the alleged mistreatment by the Spanish of British seamen.\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the terms of the Treaty of Seville (1729), the British had agreed not to trade with the Spanish colonies. To verify this, the Spanish were allowed to board British vessels in Spanish waters. English sea captain Robert Jenkins of the <i>Rebecca</i> claims that in April 1731 during one such inspection, the Spanish cut off his ear. In 1738 Jenkins appears before the House of Commons in London and exhibits the ear, whipping up war fever and providing the name for the war. British prime minister Robert Walpole declares war on Spain on October 23, 1739, and Spain replies with its own declaration on November 28. In 1742 the conflict merges into the larger War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748).\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing initial British successes, the war sees indecisive naval operations against Cartagena; St. Augustine in Florida; Havana, Cuba; and Panama. Both sides also send out large numbers of privateers. The fighting eventually winds down as both sides \r\ndivert resources to the fighting in Europe. This war is settled by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, without gain of territory by either side.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<span style="color:#cc0000;">November 21, 1739</span><br>\r\nAs part of the War of Jenkins’ Ear, British capture of Portobelo. In the first major action of the war, on November 21, 1739, British\r\nVice Admiral Edward Vernon leads six ships of the line against the Spanish silver-transshipment port of Portobelo (Puerto Bello) in New Granada (present-day Panama). Vernon sends ashore a party of marines and sailors who, supported by his ships in the harbor, proceed to capture the well-built but inadequately manned Spanish shore fortifications.\r\n<br>\r\nVernon remains in Portobelo until March 1740, when he sails to Fort San Lorenzo at the mouth of the Chagres River, Panama. That fort surrenders after a two-day naval bombardment. After sacking the customhouse, Vernon demolishes the fort on March 29 and returns to Portobelo. These two easy and profitable victories are widely celebrated in Britain. In 1740 during a dinner in honor of Vernon in London, the song “God Save the King," now the British national anthem, is for the first time performed in public.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n</p>	1739	1739	4	59	A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East by Spencer C.

83	A Failed Revolt	<p class="entry columns">The Pima Indians have lived for many centuries in scattered locations throughout what are today the western two-thirds of southern Arizona and northern Sonora. While the Pimas Altos (Upper Pima Indians) lived in the north, their linguistic brethren, the Pima Bajo (Lower Pima) lived farther south in lower Sonora.\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the 1740s, the Pima Indians began to feel agitated by the presence of the Spaniards in their territory. In November 1751, under the leadership of a Pima leader, Captain-General Luis Oacpicagigua, the Pima rose in revolt. Within a few days more than a hundred settlers, miners, and ranchers were killed. Churches were burned, and two priests were also killed. However, on January 4, 1752, approximately 2,000 northern Pimans attacked less than one hundred Spaniards, only to be repulsed with a loss of forty-three dead. The Pima Revolt lasted only four months, ending with the surrender of Luis Oacpicagigua, who offered himself in sacrifice and atonement for his whole people, endeavoring to spare them the consequences of their uprising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:90%;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n<strong>Who was Oacpicagigua?</strong><br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/1751pima.jpg" class="floatright">\r\n\r\nLuis Oacpicagigua was the leader of the Pima Revolt; little is known about his life before 1751. He had been appointed by the Spanish as the “Indian governor” of the province of Saric, and this obviously meant that they trusted him. Undoubtedly, Oacpicagigua must have spoken Spanish and been able to study some of their military tactics. He also had contact with the Seri, which helped him coordinate his attack on the Spanish. It is also recorded that he spoke many of the dialects of the Pima Indians. and this gave him an advantage in getting people from other tribes together to attack the Spanish.\r\n<br>\r\nThe outbreak of the revolt was the meeting Oacpicagigua held on November 20, 1751, where he outlined his plans to attack the Spanish. This shows that he clearly expected Spanish reprisals, and taken the precautions of moving the women and children into the mountains of Baboquivari so that they would not be able to be attacked when the revolt started. Certainly the first attack on the Spanish—the massacring of the 18 settlers when they came to visit Oacpicagigua at his house in Séric. showed that he recognized the need to have an incident to show that the revolt had started. However, the very lackluster nature of the subsequent attack\r\non the nearby mission, and then the rapid collapse of any really organized attack on the Spanish, points to another possible interpretation into the cause of the revolt.\r\n<br>\r\nOacpicagigua certainly knew about the war between the Spanish and the Seri, and he was well known to Diego Ortiz Parilla, who may have even encouraged him in his resentment of the Jesuits. Luis may also have known that the Spanish were planning to expand their settlements on the Gila and Colorado rivers. and felt he had to strike before this took place. In spite of this, Luis would have needed to persuade many people uncertain about attacking the Spanish to take part in the revolt, and it might also have been that the killing of the first settlers in  Oacpicagigua's own house was to show to them his commitment to the cause. Nevertheless, in spite of this, the revolt petered out fairly quickly. It failed to draw many of the Native Americans from Spanish settlements into it, and Luis  Oacpicagigua seemed to have recognized quickly the futility of any other major attacks, although isolated ones continuing for months.\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that his former friendship with Diego Ortiz Parilla had caused Luis Oacpicagigua to ﬁnally turn himself in. In May 1753, Oacpicagigua and another Pima Indian leader, Luis of Pitic, were asked to meet with the Spanish authorities. They were immediately arrested and brutally interrogated by the Spanish. Both tried to commit suicide in prison, but remained a|ive—Oacpicagigua remaining a prisoner until his death at Horcasitas Jail in early 1755.\r\n</p>	1751	1752	7	53	SONORA: FOUR CENTURIES OF INDIGENOUS RESISTANCE By John P.

84	Brazilian Gold, African Slaves	<p class="entry columns">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/slaverybrazil.gif" class="floatright">\r\n\r\n\r\nEngland and Holland, the leading gold and slave contrabandists, amassed fortunes in the illegal &quot;black meat&quot; traffic and are said to have illicitly garnered more than half the metal the Portuguese Crown was supposed to get from Brazil in quinto real tax. But Brazilian gold was channeled to London by licit as well as illicit methods. The gold boom, which brought a host of Portuguese to Minas Gerais, sharply stimulated colonial demand for industrial products and at the same time provided the means to pay for them. Just as Potosi silver rebounded off Spanish soil, Minas Gerais gold only reached Portugal in transit. The metropolis became an intermediary. In 1755 the Marquis de Pombal, Portugal's prime minister, tried to revive a protectionist policy, but it was too late. He declared that the English had conquered Portugal without the trouble of a conquest, that they were supplying two-thirds of its needs, and that British agents controlled the whole of Portuguese trade. Portugal was producing almost nothing, and the wealth brought by gold was so illusory that even the black slaves who mined it were clothed by the British.<br>\r\nCelso Furtado has noted that Britain, following a farsighted policy with respect to industrial development, used Brazilian gold to pay for essential imports from other countries and could thus concentrate on investments in the manufacturing sector. Thanks to this historical graciousness on the part of the Portuguese, Britain could apply rapid and efficient technical innovations. Europe's financial center moved from Amsterdam to London. According to British sources, the value of Brazilian gold arriving in London reached £50,000 a week in some periods. Without this tremendous accumulation of gold reserves, Britain would not have been able, later on, to confront Napoleon.</p>	1755	1755	5	42	Open Veins of Latin America, Galeano	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.921313	2015-02-13 04:07:47.921313	\N

251	The Occupation Before Trujillo	<p class="entry columns3" style="position:relative;top:-68px;">\r\n<font style="color:#cc0000;font-weight:bold;">In 1916, the US invades the Dominican Republic and occupies the country until 1924. The US military kicks peasants off land illegitimately owned by (mostly American) sugar companies, creates the National Police Force, and strictly controls the expression of dissent through censorship and imprisonment. U.S. Marines train the police forces that bring Rafael Leonidas Trujillo to power in 1930.</font>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;In the eastern and Spanish-speaking part of the island of Hispaniola, the Dominican Republic was also occupied by the Marines in 1916 under similar conditions to those of its French-speaking neighbor, Haiti. Instability and bankruptcy were the two pretexts for intervention. In the seventy years of independence since the end of Haitian control of that part of the island in 1844, the Dominican Republic had had twenty-three victorious revolutions. Civil war was the sole functioning mechanism for the transfer of political power. An elite of large landholders fought for control of the government by force of arms without establishing either a stable democracy or a permanent and effective dictatorship. The specialization of agricultural production seems to have been the cause of the fragmentation of the ruling groups. One spoke of the cocoa oligarch, the sugar imperialist, and the tobacco democrat. The governors of the provinces were actually local military leaders.\r\n<br>&emsp;Faced with the anarchy produced by the warlords, who with their military uprisings and civil wars helped to increase the national debt, the United States here as elsewhere dictated the establishment of a "neutral" police force in 1916. \r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/dominicanrepublicinvasion1916.jpg" style="width:100%;"><br>\r\n<font class="caption">The invasion force rowing into the City of Monte Cristi on the North Coast of the Dominican Republic</font>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in the Dominican Republic it was not content to prop up a government or to place it under tutelage. The United States simply abolished the local regime and replaced it with a military government with American officers as members of the cabinet. The principal direct consequence of foreign occupation was to destroy the military power of the semi-independent caudillos and to centralize the administration of the country.\r\n The National Guard created by the marines thus became the first regular standing army in the history of the Dominican Republic.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nWhile the resistance to the invader was more localized and less widespread than in the other occupied countries in the\r\narea, the new National Guard was seen as a substitute army for the occupiers and a foreign body. The Dominican bourgeoisie was largely hostile to the United States, and leading families refused to allow their offspring to become colonial officers. Also, the American authorities who recruited enlisted men among the lower-class elements in the cities were unconcerned with the past conduct of the future officers, who were publicly denounced in the press as traitors to the nation.\r\n<br>&emsp;Thus it was that a former telegraph operator and later chief of the private police force of a sugar plantation joined the gendarmerie of the marines. His rise was meteoric—lieutenant in 1919, captain in 1922, commandant in 1924, and chief of the general staff in 1928. The man with this less than brilliant background, <a data-entry="263" data-year="1930" class="inline">Rafael Leonidas Trujillo</a>, would soon be a generalissimo. The future "satrap of the Dominican Republic," the "little Caesar of the Caribbean," had the confidence of the marines.

227	Vaccine Revolt	<p class="entry columns">\r\n<img src="../mapimages/vaccinerevolt1904brazil.jpg" class="floatleft">\r\n\r\n&emsp;"Urban reforms" were aimed not just at modernizing cities' infrastructure but at transforming their class and racial composition. Over the course\r\nof the 1800s, workers had crowded into decaying colonial-era mansions and\r\nhouses that had been subdivided into tenements that went by different names in\r\ndifferent countries: <i>Conventillos</i> (little convents) in Argentina and Uruguay; <i>cortiços</i> (beehives) and <i>cabeças de  porco</i> (hogsheads) in Brazil; <i>solares</i> (mansions) in\r\nCuba. As the export boom attracted growing numbers of migrants to the region's\r\ncities, these urban slum communities grow as well. Their overcrowding and crude\r\nsanitary conditions contributed to high urban death rates, crime, and occasional\r\noutbreaks of epidemic disease that threatened all city dwellers. And throughout\r\nAfro-Latin America, they were heavily black and mulatto. In Brazil and Cuba,\r\nwhere thousands of recently freed libertos sought to escape their recent servitude\r\nby moving to the cities, they were overwhelmingly so. Surveys of Havana slums\r\nfound that 95 percent or more of their inhabitants were black and mulatto. In\r\nRio de Janeiro, black migrants from Bahia streamed into the center-city neighborhood\r\nnext to the docks, which became known as Little Africa. As that neighborhood\r\nfilled up, other Bahian migrants built Rio's first <i>favela</i>, a community of\r\nmakeshift huts and shacks on a hill behind the Ministry of War. Over the course\r\nof the 1900s, favelas spread throughout the city and became a ubiquitous form of\r\nhousing for the poor, who, as at the turn of the century. were predominantly\r\nAfro-Brazilian.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIt was largely in order to remove poverty and blackness from the city center\r\nthat the federal government demolished and rebuilt much of Rio's downtown in\r\nthe early 1900s, expelling the cortiços' inhabitants to squalid, remote suburbs\r\nalong the railroad line north of the city. Center-city residents fought back with\r\nthe Vaccine Revolt, a week of urban riots in 1904. The immediate cause of the rebellion\r\nwas a government campaign to vaccinate the population against smallpox,\r\nin which health officials entered working-class homes, often without permission,\r\nand inoculated every member of the family. Poor families reacted\r\nangrily to this aggressive state intrusion into the home, and they protested as well\r\nthe destruction of inner-city neighborhoods that had provided affordable housing\r\nnear their places of work. Many, perhaps most, of the rioters were Afro-Brazilian.\r\nAs one such protestor was carried off to jail. he shouted to the crowd that he\r\nwas fighting "to show the government that it can't put its foot on the people's\r\nneck .... Every now and then it's good for black folk to show that we know how to\r\ndie like men!"\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nFederal troops and police easily put down the Vaccine Revolt, and the government\r\npushed on with its program of urban renewal. Ultimately, however, Latin\r\nAmerican governments' ability to rebuild their urban centers was limited.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="caption"><i>Pictured</i>, Streetcar turned over\r\nafter the revolt.\r\n</p>	1904	1904	7	22	Afro-Latin America, 1800-2000 By George Reid Andrews	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:47.945745	2015-02-13 04:07:47.945745	\N

85	Purported Slave Revolt quashed in Minas Gerais	<img src="/mapimages/brazilrunawayslaves.jpg" style="position:relative;left:-10px;">\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="background:white; width:735px;padding:20px; position:relative; top:-150px;left:-10px;">In 1756, an alleged slave conspiracy caused much concern among the colonial elite in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Reportedly, runaway slaves living in the quilombo Campo Grande had plotted a rebellion that never actually took place. \r\n<br>\r\nOne of the most important quilombos in colonial Brazil was Campo Grande, which consisted of some twenty-five different settlements. By the 1750s, its population had surpassed 20,000. This quilombo was also significant because it seems that in addition to runaway slaves, many of the original inhabitants were free blacks and mulatoes and poor whites. \r\n<br>\r\nIn 1756, the inhabitants of Campo Grande purportedly planned a rebellion, in which they would join with slaves against the European colonists in Minas Gerais. According to rumors at the time, the Africans were planning to attack on holy Thursday while the white Brazilians attended church services. Reportedly, they would kill all of the white and mulatto men, while sparing the women. The plot never came to fruition, perhaps because it was discovered before it began, although there is no real evidence that the plot was genuine. This incident is important, however, in that it demonstrates the extent to which white Brazilians feared runaway black communities.

87	Coromantees	<p class="entry columns">One of Jamaica's strongest insurrections of the eighteenth century started in the northeastern part of the island in April 1760 and rapidly spread westward, attracting perhaps as many as thirty thousand rebels. Like their leader, Tacky, nearly all of the rebels were African-born Akans—called Coromantees in Jamaica—from the West African coast then known as the Gold Coast, now Ghana. While destroying property and creating panic among the whites, the rebels avoided outright battles with army regulars and militia. The military forces were supported by many of the island's maroons, who had gained their freedom by promising to assist authorities in putting down slave revolts and returning fugitives. After more than a year of fighting, the combined force of soldiers, militia, and maroons defeated the rebels in the summer of 1761. \r\n<br>\r\nMany rebels, including Tacky, were killed before the revolt was suppressed. Sporadic fighting continued in western Jamaica for months, and martial law was maintained until October 1761. By the time the last rebels surrendered, between three hundred and four hundred rebels had been killed, along with sixty whites and sixty free blacks. About 350 rebels were arrested, of whom about one hundred were brutally executed—some were slowly burned and others suspended and starved to death. Several rebels committed suicide rather than submit to torture and a more brutal death, and many were deported to the penal colony in British Honduras (now Belize).</p>	1760	1761	6	50	Slave Revolts	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:48.038924	2015-02-13 04:07:48.038924	\N

90	Cuffy	<p class="entry columns">Berbice Slave revolts erupts in the Dutch colony of Berbice (modern-day Guyana).\r\nIn February 1763, a huge uprising rocked Berbice, a Dutch colony on South America's northeast coast that is now part of Guyana. In 1581, the Dutch had colonized the region, setting up sugar plantations and bringing slave labor from Africa. As in many other European colonies outside of the 13 British colonies, the number of slaves in Guyana greatly outnumbered whites. At the time of the 1763 revolt, the population of blacks in the colony was about 10 times greater than that of whites.\r\n<br>Known as the Great Rebellion, the revolt in Guyana involved as many as half the slaves in the entire colony. Triggered by the cruel treatment of slaves, the rebellion began on one plantation where slaves killed their overseer and a carpenter and burned down the owner's house. The rebels then marched from plantation to plantation, and at each, unhappy slaves joined the cause. During the rebellion, many whites were killed, and many plantations and fields were burned.The uprising was led by a slave named Cuffy, a cooper(barrel maker) in the colony. Cuffy and his army of slaves eventually overthrew the Dutch government and took control. The rebels managed to stay in power for more than a year before being defeated by European forces. \r\n<br>By late March, the slave rebels controlled most of the colony, but they were not able to take the island's largest fort. Eventually, reinforcements arrived and aided by conflict within rebel ranks were able to reestablish control over the colony. About 60 percent of the whites died during the rebellion and almost 40 percent of the slaves. Of the rebels, 128 were executed in various cruel ways designed to dissuade the slaves from further revolts. As the rebellion fell apart, Cuffy took his own life to avoid being tortured and executed. Today, he is considered a national hero in Guyana.</p>	1763	1764	6	46	Historical Dictionary of Slavery and Abolition By Martin A.

525	Bacon&rsquo;s Rebellion	<div class="page" data-title="another page"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="background-color:white;padding:9px; position: relative; top: 336px;">\r\n\r\n<span class="intro">Whites and blacks unite in Bacon&rsquo;s rebellion in Virginia in 1687.</span>\r\n&emsp;\r\nIn 1676, seventy years after Virginia was founded, a hundred years before it supplied leadership for\r\nthe American Revolution, that colony faced a rebellion of white frontiersmen, joined by slaves and\r\nservants, a rebellion so threatening that the governor had to flee the burning capital of Jamestown,\r\nand England decided to send a thousand soldiers across the Atlantic, hoping to maintain order\r\namong forty thousand colonists. This was Bacon's Rebellion. After the uprising was suppressed, its\r\nleader, Nathaniel Bacon, dead, and his associates hanged, Bacon was described in a Royal\r\nCommission report:\r\n<br><span class="blockquote"  style="font-style: italic;font-size:1.1em;color: #cc0000;">\r\nHe was said to be about four or five and thirty years of age, indifferent tall but slender, black-hair'd\r\nand of an ominous, pensive, melancholly Aspect, of a pestilent and prevalent Logical discourse\r\ntending to atheisme... . He seduced the Vulgar and most ignorant people to believe (two thirds of\r\neach county being of that Sort) Soe that their whole hearts and hopes were set now upon Bacon.\r\nNext he charges the Governour as negligent and wicked, treacherous and incapable, the Lawes and\r\nTaxes as unjust and oppressive and cryes up absolute necessity of redress. Thus Bacon encouraged\r\nthe Tumult and as the unquiet crowd follow and adhere to him, he listeth them as they come in\r\nupon a large paper, writing their name circular wise, that their Ringleaders might not be found out.\r\nHaving connur'd them into this circle, given them Brandy to wind up the charme, and enjoyned\r\nthem by an oath to stick fast together and to him and the oath being administered, he went and\r\ninfected New Kent County ripe for Rebellion.\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="another page"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="background-color:white;padding:9px;">\r\n&emsp;\r\nBacon's Rebellion began with conflict over how to deal with the Indians, who were close by, on the\r\nwestern frontier, constantly threatening. Whites who had been ignored when huge land grants\r\naround Jamestown were given away had gone west to find land, and there they encountered\r\nIndians. Were those frontier Virginians resentful that the politicos and landed aristocrats who\r\ncontrolled the colony's government in Jamestown first pushed them westward into Indian territory,\r\nand then seemed indecisive in fighting the Indians? That might explain the character of their\r\nrebellion, not easily classifiable as either antiaristocrat or anti-Indian, because it was both.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAnd the governor, William Berkeley, and his Jamestown crowd-were they more conciliatory to the\r\nIndians (they wooed certain of them as spies and allies) now that they had monopolized the land in\r\nthe East, could use frontier whites as a buffer, and needed peace? The desperation of the\r\ngovernment in suppressing the rebellion seemed to have a double motive: developing an Indian\r\npolicy which would divide Indians in order to control them (in New England at this very time,\r\nMassasoit's son Metacom was threatening to unite Indian tribes, and had done frightening damage\r\nto Puritan settlements in "King Philip's War"); and teaching the poor whites of Virginia that\r\nrebellion did not pay-by a show of superior force, by calling for troops from England itself, by\r\nmass hanging.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Violence had escalated on the frontier before the rebellion. Some Doeg Indians took a few hogs to redress a debt, and whites, retrieving the hogs, murdered two Indians. The Doegs then sent out a\r\nwar party to kill a white herdsman, after which a white militia company killed twenty-four Indians.\r\nThis led to a series of Indian raids, with the Indians, outnumbered, turning to guerrilla warfare. The\r\nHouse of Burgesses in Jamestown declared war on the Indians, but proposed to exempt those\r\nIndians who cooperated. This seemed to anger the frontiers people, who wanted total war but also\r\nresented the high taxes assessed to pay for the war.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nTimes were hard in 1676. "There was genuine distress, genuine poverty.... All contemporary\r\nsources speak of the great mass of people as living in severe economic straits," writes Wilcomb\r\nWashburn, who, using British colonial records, has done an exhaustive study of Bacon's Rebellion.\r\nIt was a dry summer, ruining the corn crop, which was needed for food, and the tobacco crop,\r\nneeded for export. Governor Berkeley, in his seventies, tired of holding office, wrote wearily about\r\nhis situation: "How miserable that man is that Governes a People where six parts of seaven at least\r\nare Poore Endebted Discontented and Armed."\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nHis phrase "six parts of seaven" suggests the existence of an upper class not so impoverished. In\r\nfact, there was such a class already developed in Virginia. Bacon himself came from this class, had\r\na good bit of land, and was probably more enthusiastic about killing Indians than about redressing\r\nthe grievances of the poor. But he became a symbol of mass resentment against the Virginia\r\nestablishment, and was elected in the spring of 1676 to the House of Burgesses. When he insisted\r\non organizing armed detachments to fight the Indians, outside official control, Berkeley proclaimed\r\nhim a rebel and had him captured, whereupon two thousand Virginians marched into Jamestown to\r\nsupport him. Berkeley let Bacon go, in return for an apology, but Bacon went off, gathered his\r\nmilitia, and began raiding the Indians.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;\r\nBacon's "Declaration of the People" of July 1676 shows a mixture of populist resentment against\r\nthe rich and frontier hatred of the Indians. It indicted the Berkeley administration for unjust taxes,\r\nfor putting favorites in high positions, for monopolizing the beaver trade, and for not protecting the\r\nwestern formers from the Indians. Then Bacon went out to attack the friendly Pamunkey Indians,\r\nkilling eight, taking others prisoner, plundering their possessions.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThere is evidence that the rank and file of both Bacon's rebel army and Berkeley's official army\r\nwere not as enthusiastic as their leaders. There were mass desertions on both sides, according to\r\nWashburn. In the fall, Bacon, aged twenty-nine, fell sick and died, because of, as a contemporary\r\nput it, "swarmes of Vermyn that bred in his body." A minister, apparently not a sympathizer, wrote\r\nthis epitaph:\r\n<span class="blockquote" style="font-style: italic;font-size:1.1em;color: #cc0000;">\r\nBacon is Dead I am sorry at my heart,<br>\r\nThat lice and flux should take the hangmans part.\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="another page"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="background-color:white;padding:9px;">\r\n\r\n&emsp;\r\nThe rebellion didn't last long after that. A ship armed with thirty guns, cruising the York River,\r\nbecame the base for securing order, and its captain, Thomas Grantham, used force and deception to\r\ndisarm the last rebel forces. Coming upon the chief garrison of the rebellion, he found four hundred\r\narmed Englishmen and Negroes, a mixture of free men, servants, and slaves. He promised to\r\npardon everyone, to give freedom to slaves and servants, whereupon they surrendered their arms\r\nand dispersed, except for eighty Negroes and twenty English who insisted on keeping their arms.\r\nGrantham promised to take them to a garrison down the river, but when they got into the boat, he\r\ntrained his big guns on them, disarmed them, and eventually delivered the slaves and servants to\r\ntheir masters. The remaining garrisons were overcome one by one. Twenty-three rebel leaders were\r\nhanged.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;It was a complex chain of oppression in Virginia. The Indians were plundered by white\r\nfrontiersmen, who were taxed and controlled by the Jamestown elite. And the whole colony was\r\nbeing exploited by England, which bought the colonists' tobacco at prices it dictated and made\r\n100,000 pounds a year for the King. Berkeley himself, returning to England years earlier to protest\r\nthe English Navigation Acts, which gave English merchants a monopoly of the colonial trade, had\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n<span class="blockquote"  style="font-style: italic;font-size:1.1em;color: #cc0000;">\r\n... we cannot but resent, that forty thousand people should be impoverish'd to enrich little more than\r\nforty Merchants, who being the only buyers of our Tobacco, give us what they please for it, and\r\nafter it is here, sell it how they please; and indeed have forty thousand servants in us at cheaper\r\nrates, than any other men have slaves....\r\n</span>\r\n&emsp;\r\nFrom the testimony of the governor himself, the rebellion against him had the overwhelming\r\nsupport of the Virginia population. A member of his Council reported that the defection was\r\n"almost general" and laid it to "the Lewd dispositions of some Persons of desperate Fortunes" who\r\nhad "the Vaine hopes of takeing the Countrey wholley out of his Majesty's handes into their owne."\r\nAnother member of the Governor's Council, Richard Lee, noted that Bacon's Rebellion had started\r\nover Indian policy. But the "zealous inclination of the multitude" to support Bacon was due, he\r\nsaid, to "hopes of levelling."\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n"Levelling" meant equalizing the wealth. Levelling was to be behind countless actions of poor\r\nwhites against the rich in all the English colonies, in the century and a half before the Revolution.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe servants who joined Bacon's Rebellion were part of a large underclass of miserably poor\r\nwhites who came to the North American colonies from European cities whose governments were\r\nanxious to be rid of them. In England, the development of commerce and capitalism in the 1500s\r\nand 1600s, the enclosing of land for the production of wool, filled the cities with vagrant poor, and\r\nfrom the reign of Elizabeth on, laws were passed to punish them, imprison them in workhouses, or\r\nexile them. The Elizabethan definition of "rogues and vagabonds" included:\r\n<span class="blockquote"  style="font-style: italic;font-size:1.1em;color: #cc0000;">\r\n... All persons calling themselves Schollers going about begging, all Seafaring men pretending\r\nlosses of their Shippes or goods on the sea going about the Country begging, all idle persons going\r\nabout in any Country either begging or using any subtile crafte or unlawful Games ... comon\r\nPlayers of Interludes and Minstrells wandring abroade ... all wandering persons and comon\r\nLabourers being persons able in bodye using loytering and refusing to worke for such reasonable\r\nwages as is taxed or commonly given....\r\n</span>\r\n&emsp;\r\nSuch persons found begging could be stripped to the waist and whipped bloody, could be sent out\r\nof the city, sent to workhouses, or transported out of the country.\r\n</p>	1687	1687	7	74	A People's History of the United States, Howard Zinn	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:48.102356	2015-02-13 04:07:48.102356	\N

Mounted on his white horse, Tupac Amaru entered the plaza of Tungasuca and announced to the sound of drums and pututus that he had condemned the royal Corregidor Antonio Juan de Arriaga to the gallows and put an end to the Potosi mita. A few days later Tupac issued a decree liberating the slaves. He abolished all taxes and forced labor in all forms. The Indians rallied by the thousands to the forces of the &quot;father of all the poor and all the wretched and helpless.&quot; He moved against Cuzco at the head of his guerilleros, promising them that all who died while under his orders in this war would return to life to enjoy the happiness and wealth the invaders had wrested from them. Victories and defeats followed; in the end, betrayed and captured by one of his own chiefs, Tupac was handed over in chains to the royalists. The Examiner Areche entered his cell to demand, in exchange for promises, the names of his rebel accomplices. Tupac Amaru replied scornfully, &quot;There are no accomplices here but you and I. You, the oppressor and I, the liberator. Both of us deserve death!&quot;<img src="/mapimages/tupac-amaru-execution.jpg" style="padding:12px;column-span:all;">\r\nTupac was tortured, along with his wife, his children, and his chief aides, in Cuzco's Plaza del Wacaypata. His tongue was cut out; his arms and legs were tied to four horses with the intention of quartering him, but his body would not break; he was finally beheaded at the foot of the gallows. His head was sent to Tinta, one arm to Tungasuca and the other to Carabaya, one leg to Santa Rosa and the other to Livitaca. The torso was burned and the ashes thrown in the Rio Watanay. It was proposed that all his descendants be obliterated up to the fourth generation.\r\n<br>\r\nNearly two centuries had to pass after Tupac Amaru's death before the nationalist general Juan Velasco Alvarado would take up and apply Tupac's resounding, never forgotten words: &quot;Campesino! Your poverty shall no longer feed the master!&quot;</p>	1781	1781	2	65		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:48.127986	2015-02-13 04:07:48.127986	\N

95	Communeros revolt breaks out in Colombia	<p class="entry columns">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/manuelabeltran.gif">\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n&emsp;\r\nIn 1781 New Granada erupted in a movement which provided a model sequence of Bourbon innovation, colonial resistance and renewed absolutism. The principal cause of outrage was the procedure of the regent and visitor-general, Juan Francisco Gutierrez de Pineres, whose ruthless methods and uncompromising demands contrasted harshly with the traditional process of bargain and compromise. He increased the alcabala sales tax to 4 per cent, took it out of farm into direct administration and revived an obsolete tax for naval defense. He also reorganized the tobacco and spirits monopolies, increasing the price to the consumer and, in the case of tobacco, restricting production to high quality areas. These burdens fell on a stagnant economy, poor population and, above all, numerous small farmers. After a series of protests and disturbances, initiated by a woman shopkeeper, Manuela Beltrán, ripping down the edict and declaring "long live the king and death to bad government!", serious rebellion broke out on March 16,1781 centered on Socorro and San Gil. The rebels refused to pay taxes, attacked government warehouses, drove out the Spanish authorities and, in the name of the común, proclaimed a group of leaders. The chief of these was Juan Francisco Berbeo, a hacendado of modest means and some military experience. And soon a movement which began as a popular and predominantly mestizo insurrection came under the command of the Creole elite of land and office, who joined it with some trepidation in order to control what they could not prevent.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe comuneros were a powerful force, at least in numbers, and a horde many thousands strong marched on Bogota, together with a band of Indians. They could have broken into the capital and imposed a reign of terror on Spaniards and Creoles alike. But Berbeo and his associates were not revolutionaries. The cry of their movement was the traditional one, 'Long live the king and death to bad government'. The tyranny they opposed was that of the Spanish bureaucracy, not the structure of colonial society. Berbeo and the other Creoles, therefore, held back the rebel army, preferring to negotiate with Archbishop Caballero y Gongora and indirectly with the elite in Bogota. This was the traditional way, and the result was a compromise settlement, the capitulations of Zipaquira (June 8, 1781). These provided for the suppression of the tobacco monopoly and of various taxes; the restriction and reduction of the alcabala from 4 to 2 per cent; certain administrative reforms favoring local self-government; greater access to office for Americans; and improved conditions for the Indians.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nHowever, the negotiations are not brokered in good faith and several of the Comunero leaders will be executed.\r\n</p>	1781	1781	6	30	Cambridge History of Latin America, Volume 3	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:48.141321	2015-02-13 04:07:48.141321	\N

The chief's son took the German scholar on a tour of the ruins of the town and the rubble of the old Inca palace, and spoke as they walked of the fabulous treasures hidden beneath the dust and ashes. &quot;Don't you sometimes feel like digging for the treasure to satisfy your needs?&quot; Humboldt asked him. The youth replied: &quot;No, we never feel like doing that. My father says it would be sinful. If we were to find the golden branches and fruits, the white people would hate us and do us harm.&quot; The chief himself raised wheat in a small field, but that was not enough to save him from white covetousness.

British prime minister William Pitt the Younger (1783-1806) and his first lord of the Admiralty, Lord Melville (1802-1806), were keenly interested in Latin America. They did not approve of a unilateral venture headed by General Sir William Beresford and Commodore Sir Hope Popham in 1806. On 27 June, Beresford's force of 1,600 men, which had sailed front Cape Town across the Atlantic, landed outside the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, all without permission from the Crown. Beresford deposed the Spanish viceroy and declared himself governor of Buenos Aires under the authority of King George III. Just one British soldier was killed in the capture of Buenos Aires. The escapade did not last long.<br> Local aristocrats united to defeat the British in August 1806, and, rather generously, the British force was allowed to sail back to London. The spark of freedom had been planted in Latin America. British pride had also been affronted, but a second expedition against Buenos Aires in 1808, led by Lieutenant General John Whitlocke, was even more catastrophic. The British lost 2,200 men in the fighting. \r\n</p>\r\n<i>Pictured, Beresford surrenders to Santiago de Liniers</i>	1806	1806	1	3	Historical Dictionary of British Foreign Policy  By Peter Neville	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:48.17382	2015-02-13 04:07:48.17382	\N
110	"Quixote but not mad"	<p class="entry columns" style="max-height:600px;">\r\n\r\nFrancisco de Miranda leads an unsuccessful rebellion against the Spanish in Venezuela. The Venezuelan rebel, personally opposed to slavery, offered freedom in return for 10 years military service.\r\n<br>\r\nFrancisco de Miranda, who had read the works of the\r\n<i>philosophes</i> during his army service in Spain in the 1770s, transformed\r\nideology into activism. It was in New York, in 1784, that Francisco de Miranda conceived\r\nthe idea of 'the liberty and independence of the whole Spanish American\r\ncontinent'. The model of revolution offered by France had less appeal. As\r\nMiranda observed in 1799, &quot;We have before our eyes two great examples,\r\nthe American and the French Revolutions. Let us prudently imitate the\r\nfirst and carefully shun the second.&quot; <br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/arturomichelena.jpg" style="float: right; margin:5px 9px 5px 5px; max-height:40%;max-width:40%;">\r\nSpanish American revolutionaries anxiously disassociated themselves\r\nfrom the Haitian revolution. Miranda in particular was concerned about\r\nits effect on his reputation in England: &quot;I confess that much as I desire the\r\nliberty and independence of the New World, I fear anarchy and revolution\r\neven more. God forbid that the other countries suffer the same fate\r\nas Saint-Domingue, scene of carnage and crimes, committed on the\r\npretext of establishing liberty; better that they should remain another\r\ncentury under the barbarous and senseless oppression of Spain.&quot;\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nMiranda argued that it was vital for him to reach Venezuela first, before\r\nthe Haitians did, and in 1806 he led a tiny expedition to his homeland.\r\nUnfortunately for his reputation he stopped to re-group in Haiti, where\r\nhe was advised not to be content with exhorting the Creoles to rise but &quot;to\r\ncut off heads and burn property&quot;, and where a rumour started that he\r\nplanned to use black Haitians. In fact, Miranda was as socially conservative\r\nas other Creoles and he had no intention of inciting a race war. But\r\nthe damage was done. At Coro he was met first by a stony silence then by\r\nopposition from Creole landowners, who denounced him as a &quot;heretic&quot;\r\nand a &quot;traitor&quot;.\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time both mantuanos and the population at large rallied to the side of the Spanish\r\nauthorities against Miranda, whose call for outright independence still\r\nappeared too radical. The fear of inadvertently setting off a Haitian-style\r\nuprising among slaves and free pardos, who together amounted to over\r\nhalf the population of Venezuela, was a particular reason for caution\r\namong upper-class Creoles. At the same time, fear of the masses was an\r\nimportant reason for not leaving the maintenance of order to the\r\nappointed servants of a weakening and seemingly unreliable Spanish\r\ngovernment, which had already on various occasions shown itself too\r\nwilling to encourage the aspirations of the <i>pardos</i>.\r\n<br>\r\n Simon Bolívar, who followed Miranda as a leading figure in Venezuelan revolutionary circles (and who was a member of the group that arrested Miranda and turned him over to the Spanish), actively recruited slaves beginning in 1816, and would not have succeeded without drawing them away from the royalist cause.<br>\r\n\r\n</p>	1806	1806	6	75	The Cambridge History of Latin America - Volume 3	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:48.183194	2015-02-13 04:07:48.183194	\N

The company formed a guard that included U.S. marines, who caught dozens of the looters. "All caught red handed were immediately tried and on the following day shot," the New York Times reported. "Fifty-eight persons, among whom, it is believed, were several innocent people, were thus summarily despatched." Defeated by government troops, Prestan fled by boat to Cartagena.

105	The Second Maroon War	<p class="entry intro" style="background-color:white; padding:9px;">Unhappy with the treaties that ended the First Maroon War, the maroons of Trelawney Town in Jamaica launch the Second Maroon War against the British colonial government. Captured Africans try unsuccessfully to seize control of the ship Liberty.</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Causes"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="background-color:white; padding:9px;">&emsp;\r\nDespite the fears and rumors linking French and Haitian revolutionary activity to Jamaican insurrection, it was a confluence of local resentments that prompted the actions of the Trelawny Maroons.&nbsp; As the population grew, all of the maroon communities found the original land allotment from the 1739 treaty to be inadequate, and by the 1790s Trelawny Town was suffering from a land shortage.&nbsp; At the same time, the town was experiencing a weakening of local authority.&nbsp; Many members of the community were very aggrieved by the British appointments of town superintendent in 1792 and 1794; the latter, Thomas Craskell, was thought to be particularly inept. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe immediate spark of the war occurred in July 1795 when two Trelawny Maroons were convicted of stealing pigs in Montego Bay in St. James parish.&nbsp; That parish magistrates rather than Trelawny authorities sentenced the offenders was a breach of the 1739 treaty.&nbsp; Furthermore, for the fiercely independent Maroons, the fact that their punishment, flogging, was administered by a slave (who had in fact been a runaway recovered by the Maroons) and before an audience of slaves, was exceptionally offensive.&nbsp; In the furor that began with the news of the flogging, the superintendent, Craskell, was forcibly ejected from Trelawny Town.\r\n<br>&emsp;In an effort to address Trelawny grievances regarding land, Craskell, and the flogging, numerous magistrates, local property owners, and a former, well-respected superintendent met with Trelawny authorities to discuss their concerns and offer redress.&nbsp; Despite the initial success of these negotiations, Governor Balcarres sent a letter to Britain’s Secretary for War suggesting that the French may have prompted the Maroon insurrection.&nbsp; Balcarres opposed the conciliatory efforts of the magistrates and pressed for military suppression of what, he claimed, was an imminent threat.&nbsp; Balcarres declared martial law and demanded the surrender of all Trelawny Maroons capable of bearing arms.&nbsp; The thirty-seven men who complied were imprisoned.&nbsp; Soon after, approximately 300 Maroons attacked and defeated the St. James parish militia; this was the opening battle of a nine-month engagement with British troops composed of military regulars and residents, including slaves as well as Accompong Maroon mercenaries.&nbsp; Free Afro-Jamaicans composed about one-third of the Jamaica militia.\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Causes"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="background-color:white; padding:9px;">&emsp;While numerous slaves were pressed into British service, roughly 100 to 250 defected to the Trelawny side.&nbsp; Some free Afro-Jamaicans joined the Maroon warriors as well.&nbsp; The combined force of Trewlany Maroons, slaves, and Afro-Jamaicans totaling approximately 500 sustained a successful guerilla war against much larger British forces (approximately 2500).&nbsp; Unable to secure a military victory, Balcarres proposed peace in late October, 1795.&nbsp; In December, British Major-General George Walpole wrote to Balcarres of a truce agreement he had reached with the Trelawny Maroons on the condition that they would not be deported.\r\n<br>&emsp;On December 28 Balcarres declared that the treaty would be ratified when the Trelawny Maroons met at his headquarters on January 1, 1796.&nbsp; Balcarres may have once again deliberately manipulated circumstances as the conditions of communication and travel made the three-day time frame unfeasible.&nbsp; When only three Trelawny men arrived on the first of the year, Balcarres issued <em>chasseurs</em>, the handlers of Cuban bloodhounds used throughout the Caribbean (including the First Maroon War) to track maroons, rebel slaves, and criminals.&nbsp; Many Trelawny Maroons were en route, in good faith, to Balcarres’ headquarters while others, remotely situated, may not have even learned of the treaty for several weeks.&nbsp; Some 150 fugitive slaves refused to surrender.&nbsp; Several Maroon bands continued to rout their opponents, most notably, the thirty-six combatants led by Maroon captain Leonard Parkinson, whose exploits became legendary and whose surrender at the end of March signaled the de facto end of the war.\r\n<br>&emsp;By March 1796, large numbers of Trelawny Maroons had complied with the conditions of the treaty (excepting the January 1 date) and surrendered their arms.&nbsp; Like those who had acquiesced to Balcarres at the start of war, the Trewlany Maroons were imprisoned in warships off the coast of Montego Bay.&nbsp; Recaptured rebel slaves, free blacks, and many of the Maroons were sentenced to whipping and imprisonment.&nbsp; In express violation of the terms of the treaty, Balcarras deported nearly 600 Maroons to Nova Scotia in 1796.&nbsp; Many, including Major-General Walpole, were outraged by Balcarres’ patent breech of trust.&nbsp; As a result, Walpole resigned his post in Jamaica and rejected the disbursement offered to him and Balcarres by the Jamaican Assembly.&nbsp; Discontent in Canada, the Trelawny Maroons petitioned the British government and, as did many of the African-American loyalists who emigrated to Nova Scotia after the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, they ultimately settled in Sierra Leone.&nbsp;

112	Portuguese royal family flee to Brazil after the French invasion.	<div style="background-color:white;padding:7px;position:relative;width:420px;left:560px;">\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="">In November 1807, the Braganzas, the Portuguese royal family, with its court and bureaucracy sailed with British naval escort from Portugal to Brazil. With the seat of the Portuguese government in Rio de Janeiro, many of the old restrictions on trade and commerce disappeared. Most important, the government opened Brazil's ports to British trade and merchants, manufacturing was encouraged, schools and institutions of higher education were constructed, and a new army was formed. (Everything changed again when Napoleon was defeated in 1815. Many Brazilian men and women were initially optimistic when Portugal granted Brazil coequal status as a kingdom in 1816, but Portuguese in Portugal gradually reconstructed their country and demanded that mercantilism be restored and that King João return to Portugal in 1821. Both João and his son, Pedro, recognized that too much had changed to return to the days when Brazil was a colony. Thus, as he left for Portugal, João advised his son to be ready to seize the crown of Brazil if demands for independence accelerated. Under pressure from the Portuguese Côrtes and Portuguese troops in Brazil, Pedro issued his &quot;fico&quot; or declaration that &quot;I am staying&quot; on January 9, 1822. He created a new government with some Brazilian advisors then announced &quot;Independence or Death&quot; on September 7, 1822. Three months later he was crowned Pedro I and became a more-or-less constitutional Emperor, who, nonetheless, had the power to dissolve the national assembly.)</p>\r\n<p class="caption"><i>Pictured</i>,The Queluz National Palace, Quelez, Lisbon, Portuga, fled in 1807.</p>\r\n</div>	1807	1807	1	42		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:48.254536	2015-02-13 04:07:48.254536	\N

Hidalgo, who till the age of fifty was a peaceable rural priest, pealed the bells of the church of Dolores one fine day to summon the Indians to fight for their freedom: &quot;Will you stir yourselves to the task of recovering from the hated Spaniards the lands robbed from your ancestors 300 years ago?&quot; He raised the standard of the Indian Virgin of Guadalupe and before six weeks were out 80,000 men were following him, armed with machetes, pikes, slings, and bows and arrows. The revolutionary priest put an end to tribute and divided up the lands of Guadalajara; he decreed freedom for the slaves and led his forces toward Mexico City.

123	Simon Bolivar takes command of Venezuelan independence forces.	<p class="entry columns">Simon Bolivar (1783-1830) takes command of Venezuelan independence forces. He issues this Proclamation:\r\n<br>\r\n"An army of our brothers, sent by the Sovereign Congress of New Granada, has come to liberate you. Having expelled the oppressors from the provinces of Merida and Trujillo, it is now among you. \r\n<br>\r\nWe are sent to destroy the Spaniards, to protect the Americans, and to reestablish the republican governments that once formed the Confederation of Venezuela. The states defended by our arms are again governed by their former constitutions and tribunals, in full enjoyment of their liberty and independence, for our mission is designed only to break the chains of servitude which shackle some of our towns, and not to impose laws or exercise acts of dominion to which the rules of war might entitle us. \r\n<br>Moved by your misfortunes, we have been unable to observe with indifference the afflictions you were forced to experience by the barbarous Spaniards, who have ravished you, plundered you, and brought you death and destruction. They have violated the sacred rights of nations. They have broken the most solemn agreements and treaties. In fact, they have committed every manner of crime, reducing the Republic of Venezuela to the most frightful desolation. Justice therefore demands vengeance, and necessity compels us to exact it. Let the monsters who infest Colombian soil, who have drenched it in blood, be cast out forever; may their punishment be equal to the enormity of their perfidy, so that we my eradicate the stain of our ignominy and demonstrate to the nations of the world that the sons of America cannot be offended with impunity. <br>\r\nDespite our just resentment toward the ubiquitous Spaniards, our magnanimous heart still commands us to open to them for the last time a path to reconciliation and friendship; they are invited to live peacefully among us, if they will abjure their crimes, honestly change their ways, and cooperate with us in destroying the intruding Spanish government and the reestablishment of the Republic of Venezuela.<br>\r\n Any Spaniard who does not, by every active and effective means, work against tyranny in behalf of this just cause, will be considered an enemy and punished; as a traitor to the nation, he will inevitably be shot by a firing squad. On the other hand, general and absolute amnesty is granted to those who come over to our army with or without their arms, as well as to those who render aid to the good citizens who are endeavoring to throw off the yoke of tyranny. Army officers and civil magistrates who proclaim the government of Venezuela and join us shall retain their posts and positions; in a word, those Spaniards who render outstanding service to the State shall be regarded and treated as Americans. \r\n<br>And you Americans who, by error or treachery, have been lured from the paths of justice, are informed that your brothers, deeply regretting the error of your ways, have pardoned you as we are profoundly convinced that you cannot be truly to blame, for only the blindness and ignorance in which you have been kept up to now by those responsible for your crimes could have induced you to commit them. Fear not the sword that comes to avenge you and to sever the ignoble ties with which your executioners have bound you to their own fate. You are hereby assured, with absolute impunity, of your honor, lives, and property. The single title, "Americans," shall be your safeguard and guarantee. Our arms have come to protect you, and they shall never be raised against a single one of you, our brothers.<br>\r\n This amnesty is extended even to the very traitors who most recently have committed felonious acts, and it shall be so religiously applied that no reason, cause, or pretext will be sufficient to oblige us to violate our offer, however extraordinary and extreme the occasion you may give to provoke our wrath. <br>Spaniards and Canary Islanders, you will die, though you be neutral, unless you actively espouse the cause of America's liberation. Americans, you will live, even if you have trespassed."<br>\r\nGeneral Headquarters, Trujill, June 15, 1813</p>	1813	1813	6	75		large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:48.322625	2015-02-13 04:07:48.322625	\N

125	Spanish regain control of Venezuela	<p class="entry columns "><i>Spanish counterattacks and regains control of Venezuela. Bolivar escapes to New Granada (present-day Colombia and Panama).</i>\r\n<br>With the fall of Napoleon (1814), Fernando VII returned to the Spanish throne. The king sent reinforcements to support the loyalists in Venezuela. In addition to the Spanish royalists, the republicans had other enemies. Many <i>criolla</i> planters refused to free their slaves, and breaking up the continued slave revolts thinned the patriot army. Furthermore, under the Spanish merchant and smuggler Jose Tomas Boves (1782-1814), many llaneros deserted the patriot cause in response to the continued enforcement of the llanera vagrancy laws. <br>\r\nThe Spanish army continued to attack, its ranks swelled with fresh recruits. The llaneros swept across the highlands toward Caracas, where a weakened republican army frantically awaited reinforcements from Colombia and hoped that the British might change their mind and send help. Boves and Bolivar fought several battles against each other's forces. Bolivar won most of the battles but lost the war. The patriots retreated eastward, and Boves recaptured each city in their wake. Valencia surrendered, hoping to ease the trauma, but the llaneros rounded up all the patriot supporters and executed them, treating their families with great cruelty. Boves was notorious for this cruelty toward the enemy during the Venezuelan struggle for independence. \r\n<br>Like Miranda before him, Bolivar readied a ship at La Guaira with the treasury and the silver and jewels he had taken from various churches in Caracas, so that he could buy arms in the British Antilles. He retreated to Barcelona, in the state of Anzoategui, where his forces were again defeated. The survivors pushed toward Cumana, where Bolivar boarded his ship to stop the captain from leaving with the treasury. In September 1819, Bolivar sailed for Cartagena to regroup. The remainder of his forces retreated farther east and were continuously harassed by Bovees. By December the patriots had been defeated in the east, although Boves lost his life in battle. By this time, only a handful of guerrillas remained in the west. The Second Republic was dead and Venezuela lay in ruins.  War had reduced its population, while disease and malnutrition afflicted scores of others. \r\n</p>\r\n	1814	1814	1	75	The History of Venezuela  By Hollis Micheal Tarver Denova	large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:48.356965	2015-02-13 04:07:48.356965	\N

San Martín's parents moved from Argentina to their homeland in Spain when San Martín was a young boy, where he was educated and trained as an army officer. San Martín said he switched allegiance to fight the Spanish <i>for</i> Argentina as a calling of his native land.\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his success in Argentina, San Martín took on his greatest physical battle. He led an army over a nearly 15,000-foot pass in the Andes to surprise the Spanish in the Battle of Chacabuco near Santiago, Chile, where he was victorious. A Second battle months later won Chile's independence. Focused, San Martín pressed on toward Lima, Peru, where he would eventually lead another revolution. <br>\r\nThe decision to enroll slaves was a distinguishing mark of the early republic. General José de San Martín, who heavily recruited slaves in the western provinces, proclaimed to his troops before they marches on to liberate Chile,  "Soldiers, six days ago you were slaves and now you are citizens." San Martín's largely black army defeated the royalist forces in Chile.\r\n</p>	1816	1816	1	3	"The Fruit of Freedom: Slaves and Citizens in Early Republican Argentina" by Seth Meisel AND "One Thousand Events that Shaped the World"	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:48.36639	2015-02-13 04:07:48.36639	\N

152	"Virtual Slavery"	<p class="entry columns3">Following a period of internal disputes between rival elite factions, Chiapas separates from Guatemala to join a weak Mexican state, allowing relative autonomy for local elites, and beginning decades of Liberal/Conservative struggles for control over land and Indigenous labor. Both Liberals and Conservatives accrue huge landholdings, displacing indigenous owners, and many Indigenous people are forced into virtual slavery. <br>\r\nA strong regionalist sentiment continued to characterize these groups and would shape political conflict and patterns of Indian resistance in the nineteenth century. With the virtual absence of central authority, local military leaders who had supported the independence movement assumed control of their own areas of influence. None of these caudillos could maintain control of state government, and a period of political instability continued until the national liberal forces achieved supremacy over their conservative rivals at the end of the 1860s. Political rivalries were animated by the struggle for control over Indian land and labor. The Liberal forces viewed the highland elites, in particular the church, as the main obstacle to gain access to the large supply of labor in the indigenous villages. They also sought to wrest control of lowland estates and plantations from the Dominicans.\r\n</p>	1824	1824	1	54	Zapatista Timeline by Tom Hansen and Enlace Civil and The Chiapas Rebellion: The Struggle for Land and Democracy by Neil Harvey	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:48.533731	2015-02-13 04:07:48.533731	\N

147	Demerara Slave Revolt.	<img src="/mapimages/demeraraslaverevolt1823.jpg" style="position:relative;left:-10px;top:-44px;">\r\n<div class="page" data-title="1"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="position:relative;top:-44px;">\r\n&emsp;Two of the biggest rebellions occurred in the colonies of Demerara in 1823 and Jamaica in 1831.\r\nThe British had only acquired Demerara (present-day Guyana) from the Dutch at the very end of the eighteenth century. Similar to the Aponte Rebellion, which followed a rapid increase in Cuban sugar production, Demeraran plantation owners switched from cotton to sugar to capitalize on the economic opening in the world market produced by the Haitian Revolution. The twenty-five-mile east coast of Demerara was home to some of the most exploitative sugar plantations in the New World. At the time of the insurrection in 1823, the slave population numbered 77,000, while the white population numbered only 2,500. Africans represented 54 percent of the slave population, drawn predominantly from Gold Coast Akan-speakers collectively identified as Coromantees. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the enslaved Creoles made up 46 percent of this population. As a concession to British abolitionists, masters allowed missionaries to minister to the slaves. Similar to how Aponte and his followers crafted their own ideology of liberation from disparate sources that resonated with their local and Atlantic backgrounds, Demeraran slaves appropriated the missionaries’ evangelical language and symbols and turned Sunday church services, which brought enslaved laborers together from various plantations, into organizational opportunities for the rebellion.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="3"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="position:relative;top:-44px;">\r\n&emsp;When the rebellion broke out in August 1823, in a matter of weeks the slave army numbered 10,000 to 12,000 and controlled nearly sixty plantations. Comparable to the Aponte Rebellion, Demeraran slaves believed the king and British Parliament had granted them various rights that local officials had usurped. When the colonial governor asked why the slaves revolted, in an attempt to end the rebellion through negotiation, they boldly demanded "Our rights." The governor recognized how the slaves had wed the radical beliefs of Christianity, emphasizing equality of all men before God, with abolition rumors. The slaves told the governor that "God had made them of the same flesh and blood as the whites; they were tired of being slaves; their good King has sent orders that they should be free, and they would not work any more."\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n After making it clear that they would not return to slavery, the British colonial state brought to bear its full military force and violently subdued the insurgents. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nSeveral of the leaders were decapitated after their executions and had their heads places stuck up on posts within the military fort.\r\n</p>	1823	1823	6	46	The 1812 Aponte Rebellion in Cuba and the Struggle against Atlantic Slavery by Matt D.

155	Brazilian Independence	<p class="entry ">Independence from Portugal was declared on 7 September 1822. On 12 October, the prince was acclaimed Pedro I, first Emperor of the newly created Empire of Brazil, a constitutional monarchy. The declaration of independence was opposed throughout Brazil by armed military units loyal to Portugal. The ensuing war of independence was fought across the country, with battles in the northern, northeastern, and southern regions. The last Portuguese soldiers to surrender did so in March 1824, and independence was recognized by Portugal in August 1825.</p>	1825	1825	6	16		medium	f	2015-02-13 04:07:48.614896	2015-02-13 04:07:48.614896	\N
163	The Beginning of Jamaican Emancipation	<p class="entry" style="color:#cc0000;"><img src="/mapimages/samuelsharpe.gif" style="float:right; padding:0px 10px;">\r\nBaptist Preacher Samuel Sharpe leads a revolt of up to sixty thousand slaves for ten days. Abolition of slavery had been debated in London in 1831, and white slavers in Jamaica had spent much of the year loudly protesting the proposed measures. This island-wide movement of reaction spread the news to the slaves. Sharpe and other preachers began discussing Thomas Paine in their chapels. With the demand of emancipation and normalized wages, Sharpe led a strike that became a revolt, damaging property, but killing only fourteen whites. Over five hundred Blacks were massacred in response, and Black chapels were burned to the ground. Emancipation was won by the end of the decade.\r\n<br>\r\nSharpe, today, is an official national hero of Jamaica.

164	The Bugles Sounded The Attack	<p class="entry columns">The massacres of Indians that began with Columbus never stopped. In Uruguay and Argentine Patagonia they were exterminated during the last century by troops that hunted them down and penned them in forests or in the desert so that they might not disturb the organized advance of cattle latifundia. The last of the Charruas,<i> pictured</i>, who lived by raising bulls in the wild pampas of northern Uruguay, were betrayed in 1832 by President Jose Fructuoso Rivera. Removed from the bush that gave them protection, deprived of horses and arms by false promises of friendship, they were overwhelmed at a place called Boca del Tigre. &quot;<i>The bugles sounded the attack</i>,&quot; wrote Eduardo Acevedo Diaz in La Epoca (August 19, 1890). &quot;<i>The horde churned about desperately, one after the other of its young braves falling like bulls pierced in the neck</i>.&quot; Many chiefs were killed. The few Indians who could break through the circle of fire took vengeance soon afterward. Pursued by Rivera's brother, they laid an ambush and riddled him and his soldiers with spears. The chief Sepe &quot;<i>had the tip of his spear adorned with some tendons from the corpse.</i>&quot; <br>In Argentine, Patagonia soldiers drew pay for each pair of testicles they brought in. </p>	1832	1832	2	73	Open Veins of Latin America	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:48.630283	2015-02-13 04:07:48.630283	\N

167	Cabanagem	<p class="entry columns">\r\nFor half a century after the abolition of the Directorate in 1798, neither Portugal nor Brazil had an effective settlement policy for the Amazon Basin. Shortly before Brazil's political independence in 1822, the Belem elite began a heady orgy of political temper tantrums, pitting Portuguese against Creole in petty politicking that eventually broke into the open warfare known as the Cabanagem revolt. The political rhetoric and vitriol did not reflect fundamental social or economic differences between the participants but simply questions of political method and the spoils of office. However, by engaging numbers of the semifree peasants and detribalized Indians of the region (known as <i>caboclos</i>), workers, and marginal small farmers to do the physical fighting, the elite foretold their own destruction. In 1835, when the lower class eventually rose in rebellion against the men they perceived as authority figures, a good many individuals of the ruling class died violent deaths.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nMost of the fighting and destruction during the Cabanagem took place in and around Selem, but outbreaks of violence occurred all over the basin. It was a localized rebellion over local issues, with limited ideological scope that spread over an immense territory. It was not a revolt with a clear agenda or purpose, but the violence was often a matter of personal grudges and vendettas. The caboclos struck out against those individuals whom they saw as having wealth and power over them, most often being those of European ancestry. Although not clearly defined enough to be called race and class warfare, the Cabanagem was definitely a war between the haves and have-nots. The elite class suffered serious losses, as many died during the shelling of Belem or disappeared after fleeing the city.\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/caboclos1912.jpg"  class="floatright" style="max-width:68%">\r\nWhen most of the fighting had ended by 1836, the survivors from the elite class slowly reestablished their economic control of the basin. In time, they would again guide the reins of economic growth, but they remained extremely cautious about their relationship with the caboclos. As the issue of colonization and settlement of new areas became a major topic of debate, the residual fear of the violent potential of the caboclos may well have been one reason for the decision to bring foreign immigrants rather than resettle and subsidize the native paraenses. The elites had no intention of allowing the caboclos any opportunity for advancement.\r\n</p>\r\n<i>Pictured, Caboclos circa 1912</i>\r\n\r\n<!-- The Nineteenth-Century Context of Immigration and Colonization --><br>	1835	1840	6	19	Colonization As Exploitation in the Amazon Rain Forest, 1758-1911 By Robin Leslie Anderson	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:48.647706	2015-02-13 04:07:48.647706	\N
168	The War of Tatters	<img src="/mapimages/wartattersragamuffinarmy.jpg"><img src="/mapimages/wartattersragamuffinarmy.jpg">\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\nThe second rebellion, chronologically, was quite different in nature. It became known as the Farroupilha, a name used to characterize the radicals after the abdication of Pedro I, and took place in the southern province of Rio Grande do Sul. The province had over 100,000 inhabitants, and the capital, Porto Alegre, had, in 1830, a population of between 12,000 and 15,000. As in Para, slaves composed more or less 30 per cent of the total population. But Rio Grande do Sul had a very different social structure from the rest of Brazil. The historical circumstances of the formation of the province had led to a fusion of military status and landownership, and the militarized dominant class exercised almost total control over the subordinate groups in society. Moreover, the province had gone through an important economic transformation in the second decade of the century, moving from agriculture to livestock production. A charque industry also developed along the coast. The occupation of the Banda Oriental in 1817 had given a tremendous boost to the estancieiros. They not only bought land in what became the Cisplatine Province but also transferred vast numbers of cattle to Brazil. The loss of the Banda Oriental in 1828 had been a severe blow, although it did not stop the regular smuggling of cattle across the frontier. In fact, economic and political relations among the estancieiros of Rio Grande do Sul, Uruguay and the Argentine provinces of Entre Rios and Corrientes were an important factor in the rebellion of 1835. They formed a powerful group of caudillos in search of a political organization that could best suit their interests.\r\n<br>\r\nThe beginning of the revolt was not very different from that of the Cabanagem, in the sense that it turned around the reaction of local liberals against the formation of the caramuru Sociedade Militar in 1833 and against a president appointed by the regency. The president, who suspected secessionist plans among the local leaders, was overthrown in September 1835. Under the next president, himself a rich estancieiro, factions coalesced and in February 1836 open war broke out. In September 1836 the farroupilhas proclaimed the independence of the province under a republican government, although they were not able to keep control of the capital.In 1839, with the help  of a small naval task force organized by the Italian revolutionary, Giuseppe Garibaldi, they invaded the neighbouring province of Santa Catarina, where a shortlived republic was also proclaimed. The fight dragged on for ten years until an armistice was agreed in March 1845.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	1835	1845	1	18	THE CAMBRIDGE HISTORY OF LATIN AMERICA	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:48.656535	2015-02-13 04:07:48.656535	\N

Spanish forces responded with brutal repression, including ethnic cleansing and the most of the 1870s the rebels diverted to guerrilla war from outright insurrection.

182	Club de La Habana	<p class="entry columns">\r\n\r\n\r\n1847 \r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;As the Mexican War moves closer toward victory for the\r\nUnited States, proponents of &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot; step up efforts\r\nto annex Cuba. Some US citizens conspire with a new secret\r\norganization of pro-annexation Cubans, the Club de La Habana, founded by Miguel de Aldama, <i>Pictured</i>.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n&emsp;Miguel de Aldama typified those wealthy Creoles of Cuba who, fearing slave revolts, had become annexationists, advocates of the island's acquisition by the United States. Fears that Spain—which seemed weaker with each passing year—might eventually yield to pressures from British abolitionists and free the island's slaves nourished a growing conviction that only membership in the republican union to the north could rescue the island from a rising tide of social, economic, and political troubles. Such fears increased dramatically in 1843 when rumors of a massive slave uprising planned for Christmas Day swept the island. Whether or not the revolt, alleged to have been encouraged by the British abolitionist David Turnbull, was ever more  than a rumor, reaction to it was swift and brutal. Captain General Leopold O'Donnell, the island's chief colonial official, had been appointed to his post that autumn to end a rash of slave revolts that had already darkened the decade. In the weeks after Christmas, all of those accused of involvement in the alleged conspiracy were strapped to a ladder (<i>escalera</i>), beaten, then executed.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;In the wake of what became known as La Escalera conspiracy, more and more of Cuba's wealthy Creoles became annexationists. Creole pride might have preferred outright independence, but fears of inadvertently igniting a slave revolt were stronger. The United States seemed the best alternative to royalist Spain: an option that promised relative autonomy, a likely end to the slave trade, but immediate protection of Cuban slavery—and all without massive social upheaval.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;While reciprocal calls from the United States for Cuba's annexation had been raised since at least 1806, the two movements usually operated without coordination and, not infrequently, at cross purposes. By the mid-1840s, however, a marriage of the two Cuban annexationist movements—one in the United States, the other in Cuba—had become inevitable.\r\n<img src="/mapimages/cuba1947aldama.gif" class="floatright">\r\n\r\n</p>	1847	1847	1	32	Fatal Glory: Narciso López and the First Clandestine U.S. War Against Cuba	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:48.782316	2015-02-13 04:07:48.782316	\N
183	The Caste War of the Yucatan	<p class="entry columns3">\r\nSpecial conditions prevailed in Yucatan. The local <i>hacendados</i> were successfully growing <i>henequen</i>—sisal, a fibre-producing agave—for export and had few ties with central Mexico. Quite naturally, Yucatan embraced federalism and in 1839 rebelled against Mexico with the help of Mayan soldiers, becoming for all practical purposes an independent state. In 1840, the American traveller, John L. Stephens, found the Indian peons submissive and humble. Two years later, after his second visit, he warned:\r\n<i><font style="color:#cc0000;">\r\nWhat the consequences may be of finding themselves, after ages of servitude, once more in the possession of arms and in increasing knowledge of their physical strength is a question of momentous import to the people of that country, the solution of which no man can foretell.</font>\r\n<br>\r\n</i>\r\nStephen's forebodings were borne out five years later. In return for the service of Indian peasants as soldiers, the whites had promised to abolish or at least reduce parochial fees, to abolish the capitation tax payable by all Indian adults, and to give them free use of public and communal lands. None of these promises were fulfilled and the Mayas rebelled in the summer of 1847 with the aim of exterminating or at least expelling the white population. The revolt soon developed into full-scale war, known ever since as the War of the Castes. Mexico had just been defeated by the United States and, even had it wished to do so, was unable to send an army to Yucatan to suppress the revolt. In the cruel war which followed, the Indians almost succeeded in driving their enemies into the sea. In their despair, the whites went as far as to offer Yucatan to Great Britain, the United States, or, indeed, any country willing to protect them.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/castewaryucatan.jpg" style="width:100%;column-span: all;COLSPAN=2;">\r\n\r\n<br>  \r\nWhile Yucatan was in the throes of this race war, Indian tribes, forced southward by the expansion of the United States, invaded the sparsely populated regions of northern Mexico, burning haciendas, villages and mining settlements, and indiscriminately killing their inhabitants. Again, the Mexican government was too weak to prevent these incursions.\r\n<br>  \r\nSocial and ethnic revolt took a different form in central Mexico. Here the Indians did not form a compact, linguistic group and nor were they in a clear majority, as were the Mayas in Yucatan. However, deserters from the army, fugitives from justice, vagrants and similar elements, taking advantage of Mexico's military defeat and the chaos which followed, formed armed bands which began to terrorize the countryside. In at least one district, in the mountains of the states of Guanajuato, Queretaro and San Luis Potosi, a revolutionary agrarian movement developed. This so- called Sierra Gorda rebellion sought to give free land to hacienda tenants and peons, but the rebels were not strong enough to attack cities, and they had to be satisfied with the burning of haciendas. The Mexican ruling class, demoralized, embittered and divided, watched helplessly as the remnants of their once great country were beginning to fall apart.\r\n<br>  \r\nFollowing the caste wars of 1847—55 they managed to set up an independent state in southern Yucatan and until 1901 resisted numerous attempts by federal troops to re-establish Mexican sovereignty. Moreover, armed with weapons they purchased in neighbouring British Honduras, they frequently ventured out to raid adjacent Mexican territories with relative impunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	1847	1901	2	54	THE CAMBRIDGE HISTORY OF LATIN AMERICA Vols. 4 and 5	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:48.790891	2015-02-13 04:07:48.790891	\N

192	The Bombing of Greytown	<p class="entry ">In 1854, Naval forces bombarded and burned San Juan del Norte (Greytown) to avenge an insult to the American Minister to Nicaragua and Cornelius Vanderbilt.\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>An American Account:</strong>\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\n\r\nIn July of 1854 occurred an event in Central America which created a considerable excitement in the United States. A band of about 300 adventurers, mainly negroes from Jamaica, had occupied the port of San Juan del Norte, and began to commit depredations upon an adjacent settlement of Americans known as Punta Arenas. Finally they organised a strong force to demolish tho little colony at Punta Arenas, but their design was defeated by \r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/nicaragua1854.jpg" class="floatright">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe interposition of an American warship which happened to be in the harbor. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn May of 1854 matters were further complicated by the attempt of a body of men from Greytown to arrest in Punta Arenas the captain of one of the boats of the Accessory Transit Company of Nicaragua on a charge of murder. Solon Borland, the American minister to powers, Central Ammica, happened to be present on this occasion, and, believing that the captain of the steamboat was innocent and that the intruding party had no jurisdiction, interposed effectually to prevent violence and bloodshed. Borland afterward visited Grey town and, while there, was subjected to insult by a mob. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn receiving offical accounts of these occurences, the sloop of war <i>Cyane</i> was sent to enforce the demands of the American government—that the people of Greytown make reparation for injuries to our citizens and due-apology for their insult to Borland. But the Greytown people evinced no disposition to comply, so on July 9, 1854, after 24 hours' notice had been given, the <i>Cyane</i> opened fire on the town. Before much injury had been done the <i>Cyane</i> suspended fire in order to afford opportunity of complying with the demands which had been made. As nothing was heard from the town authorities, however, the <i>Cyane</i> continued the bombardment until the town was laid in ashes. No lives were lost and most of the buildings destroyed were of little value.&quot;This transaction,&quot; said the President, &quot;has been the subject of complaint on the part of some foreign powers and has been characterized with more of harshness than of justice.&quot; (From <i>The United States: its beginnings, progress and modern development, Volume 7</i> by Jesse Ames Spencer; 1913)\r\n\r\n</p><p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n<strong>What was the insult?</strong><br>\r\nBorland was held captive after going ashore and threatened\r\nwith arrest by the Jamaicans, but after being held 48 hours was not, due\r\nto his diplomatic immunity. While arguing with local Jamaican officials,\r\nsomeone threw a bottle in his face leaving a scar on his forehead. This incident,\r\n along with the continuing activities against the Vanderbilt\r\noperation were reported to the Pierce administration by Borland on\r\nreturn to Washington city, who then dispatched an American naval ship to\r\nthe area demanding them to apologize to the minister and to stop\r\nillegal harassment of and confiscation of property, correct other\r\nillegal activities against the Vanderbilt interests, and to make\r\nreparation or restitution for property stolen from American citizens.\r\nAfter a warning, with nothing forthcoming, the American ship and marines\r\nbombarded and burned the unoccupied British city Greytown.\r\n\r\n</p>	1854	1854	1	57		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:48.835656	2015-02-13 04:07:48.835656	\N

US occupies isthmus to quell disturbances.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/1856watermelonwar-small.jpg" style="position:relative;float:right;right:-10px;top:-17px;">\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="background-color:white; padding:7px;width:580px;position:relative;top:-290px;">\r\nFew Panamanians benefited from the construction of the Panama railroad service running from Aspinwall/Colon to Panama City (and an accompanying steam lighter service in Panama Bay). The railroad's completion was a success for its U.S. investors, in spite of the competition offered by a contemporary transit route across Nicaragua, operated by Cornelius Vanderbilt. It was also valuable to Panama's economy, since cash flow grew exponentially and many wealthy foreign businessmen set up shop in Panama City. However, the benefits were far fewer for common Panamanians. Thousands of local workers were left unemployed, disgruntled, and angry both at the American company and at the growing American control of the entire zone surrounding the railroad. The American community had grown quickly and become a contending economic and cultural force. Panamanians began to feel like foreigners in their own land. Americans also brought with them virulent racism common at the time in the United States, insensitivity toward Panamanian culture, and a sense of superiority that bordered on megalomania. The dollar and English displaced the peso and Spanish, and the first major newspaper to be published in Panama was the English language <i>Panama Star and Herald</i>. Its publisher, Archibald Boyd, was an American immigrant to Panama, and his son, Federico Boyd, became one of the ten founders of independent Panama and briefly held the presidency in 1910.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nAmong the droves of Americans crossing Panama were many unsavory types who, according to contemporary accounts, were little more than criminals. All too often, they passed their time drunk while waiting for ships and frequently showed their contempt for Panama's mixed races. One such traveler, an American named Jack Oliver, ignited the so-called "Watermelon War" in 1856. The famous incident, on April 15, 1856, laid bare the tensions, fears, and anger Panamanians experienced due to economic adjustments and foreign presence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="The Aftermath"></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="background-color:white; padding:7px;">\r\nWhen the American refused to pay for a slice of watermelon and the poor black vendor protested, the traveler produced a pistol, causing Panamanians to respond in kind. The scuffle soon degenerated into a brawl between the Americans and Panamanians, many of whom were Afro-Panamanian. Within a few hours, U.S.-owned businesses in the area lay in shambles and Americans had taken refuge in the train station. The Panamanian police arrived on the scene and, after being shot at from the train station, attacked and eventually overran it. The mob destroyed the station, tore up track, cut telegraph wires, and terrorized the Americans, who were finally escorted aboard a steam tender and taken off shore. The fatalities included fifteen Americans and two Panamanians, with dozens injured.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nA report sent to Washington detailing the incident recommended a military occupation of the isthmus, based on the "colored population's hatred of Americans" and the Colombian government's "inability to maintain order." Coupled with derogatory newspaper reports of Panamanians' shiftlessness, including an uncomplimentary article printed in the Chicago Republican by a young Samuel Clemens, public opinion toward Panama in the United States was tilted toward military intervention. Six months later, U.S. soldiers landed in Panama City and briefly took control of the railroad station. The United States justified the intervention through the Monroe Doctrine and the <a data-entry="181" data-year="1846">Bidlack-Mallarino</a> treaty with Colombia, in which the United States had pledged to keep Panama open to free transit. Adding insult to injury, Colombia was forced to pay $412,000 in restitution to the railroad for damages, further embittering public opinion in Panama toward the United States.\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first U.S. military intervention in Panama. Thirteen more would occur before Panama's independence from Colombia 47 years later. The Watermelon War underscored two recurring themes of the next fifty years: the frequency with which the United States would use force to protect its economic interest in Panama, and the way in which American cultural and racial beliefs of the time would be implanted in the isthmus. Despite British protests under the terms of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, Panama had become a protectorate of the United States. The issue of sovereignty in the transit zone would come to define Panamanians' sense of nationalism, the country's economic system, and its geopolitical future. The railroad's utility as a vital link between the two U.S. coasts had become patently clear, and the strategic value of the isthmus became imbedded in the minds of U.S. policymakers, an idea that would endure for almost a century and a half.\r\n\r\n</p>	1856	1856	6	59	Panama and the United States: The Forced Alliance  By Michael L.

197	The War of Reform (1857 - 61)	<p class="entry columns"> \r\nThe reforms embodied in the Mexican constitution of 1857 were supported by the liberals and opposed by\r\nthe conservatives. Mexico's liberal president, Ignacio Comonfort (1812-63), was forced into\r\nexile by conservative general Félix Zuloaga (1814-76), who took control of the capital,\r\nMexico City, and assumed presidential powers in early 1858, until he was replaced by Miguel\r\nMirarnon (1832-67), a conservative. A rump congress met in Querétaro and proclaimed\r\nBenito Juarez (1806-72), a liberal, president in 1858. \r\n<br>\r\nIn Mexico City, the conservatives controlled the regular army and were supported by the church and the wealthy. The government of\r\nthe liberals, who had a poorly equipped militia, was forced to flee from Querétaro to Guadalajara, from there to the Pacific coast and then to Panama. Finally, it made its capital the Mexican port of Veracruz on May 4, 1858. The United States recognized the Mexican government there in\r\n1859 and gave arms to the liberals. The liberal army under Santos Degollado (d. 1861) fought in the west but lost every major battle, including notable defeats at Tacubaya (April 11, 1859) and Celaya (November 1859). Miramon and his forces attempted to drive Juarez out of Veracruz\r\nin early 1859, but many of his men sickened and died in the lowland. \r\n<br>\r\nDegollado marched on Mexico City but suffered defeat at Chapultepec in April 1859. Desperately needing money, Juérez's government confiscated church property and thus was able to better arm and equip its armies. Jesus Gonzalez Ortega (1824-81) led liberal troops to victory near Guadalajara and afterward at Calderon (1860). Ortega's decisive defeat of Miramon's forces at the Battle of Calpulalpam on December 20, 1860, opened the way\r\nto Mexico City, which Juarez entered on January 1, 1861; he then assumed full control of the country and put into effect the reforms in the constitution.\r\n</p><p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:80%;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n\r\n<strong style="color:#cc0000"> Abraham and Benito</strong><br>\r\nA Juarez-led liberal coalition triumphed over conservatives attempting to defend the privileges of the Church. The latter were particularly enraged by the Ley Juarez (the Juarez Law), legislation that restructured the judicial system to limit the authority of military and ecclesiastical courts, and by the liberal constitution of 1857.\r\n<br>\r\nThough Abrahama Lincoln and Juarez never met personally, they formed a lifetime, long-distance mutual admiration society. Lincoln's attitude toward Juarez was no doubt shaped by the friendly feeling he perennially entertained toward Mexico. Lincoln strongly opposed the U.S.-Mexican War of 1846-1848, characterizing it as &quot;a war of conquest brought into existence to catch votes,&quot; and adding that, &quot;Mexico was in no way molesting or menacing the U.S.&quot;\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it is not known exactly when Juarez came to Lincoln's attention, we do know that Lincoln was a strong Juarez supporter by 1857, eve of the Reform War. When Juarez was temporarily driven out of Mexico City by the conservatives, Lincoln sent him a message expressing hope &quot;for the liberty of . . . your government and its people.&quot;\r\n<br>\r\nThe bond between the two leaders was greatly strengthened during the American Civil War. In 1861, the year the Civil War began, Juarez was elected president of Mexico. The Reform War had bankrupted Mexico's treasury and Juarez suspended debt payments to Mexico's chief European creditors, France, Britain and Spain. The European powers organized a punitive expedition, seizing Veracruz. But Britain and Spain pulled out when they learned of Napoleon III's desire to install a puppet government in Mexico City. The French, defeated at Puebla in 1862, poured in reinforcements and captured Mexico City in 1863. Fleeing the capital, Juarez organized resistance in the north.\r\n<br>\r\nThough Lincoln obviously had his hands full during the Civil War, he still did what he could to help Juarez. Union General Phil Sheridan wrote in his journal that, &quot;we continued covertly supplying arms and munitions to the liberals, sending as many as 30,000 muskets from the Baton Rouge alone.&quot; To Sheridan came this order from General Grant, which of course originated from Lincoln: &quot;Concentrate at all available points in the States an army strong enough to move against the invaders of Mexico... &quot;\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/benitolincoln.jpg" class="floatleft">Illustrative of how Juarez reciprocated Lincoln's friendly attitude was his response to an ill-advised overture he received from the Confederate government. The South had sent a delegation, under John T. Pickett, to try and win over the juaristas. Juarez, to put it mildly, sent the Confederates a message&#8212;throwing Pickett into a Mexico City jail for thirty days and then expelling him from the country.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<i>Photo Illustration of Lincoln and Juarez combined</i>\r\n</p>	1857	1861	1	95		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:48.898523	2015-02-13 04:07:48.898523	\N

These idyllic proceedings are the chief momenta of primitive accumulation.&quot;</i></font><br>\r\nPlunder, internal and external, was the most important means of primitive accumulation of capital, an accumulation which, after the Middle Ages, made possible a new historical stage in world economic evolution. As the money economy extended, more and more social strata and regions of the world became involved in unequal exchange. Ernest Mandel has added up the value of the gold and silver torn from Latin America up to 1660, the booty extracted from Indonesia by the Dutch East India Company from 1650 to 1780, the harvest reaped by French capital in the eighteenth-century slave trade, the profits from slave labor in the  British Antilles and from\r\na half-century of British looting in India. The total exceeds the capital invested in all European industrial enterprises operated by steam in about 1800. This enormous mass of capital, Mandel notes, created a favorable climate for investment in Europe, stimulated the &quot;spirit of enterprise,&quot; and directly financed the establishment of manufactures, which in turn gave a strong thrust to the Industrial Revolution. <br>\r\nBut at the same time the formidable international concentration of wealth for Europe's benefit prevented the jump into the accumulation of industrial capital in the plundered areas: “The double tragedy of the developing countries consists in the fact that they were not only victims of that process of international concentration, but that subsequently they have had to try and compensate for their industrial backwardness—that is, realize the primitive accumulation of industrial capital—in a world flooded with articles manufactured by an already mature industry, that of the West.”</p>\r\n<p style="font-size:80%; font-style:italic;">11th–16th century Chiriqui Gold Pendant, NYC's Metropolitan Museum of Art, gift of Alice K.

207	El Grito de Laresse ha de repetir,y entonces sabremosvencer o morir.	<p class="entry ">A revolt breaks out for independence from Spain in the town of Lares on September 23rd. Dr. Ramon Emeterio Betances and Segundo Ruiz Belvis, who is on a local committee of grievances set up by the Spanish government, create a Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico in January of 1868. The poet Lola Rodriguez de Tio is inspired by their efforts, and writes La Borinquena.

216	The 1894 US Marines Month-long Occupation of the Nicaraguan Bluefields	<p class="entry columns">\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/moskitocoast.gif" style="height:150px;padding:7px;float:left">\r\nFor a little over two centuries, the Miskito, a separate kingdom with its own monarch, would remain independent from Nicaragua. Over time, the Indian society lost its military coloration as Moravian missionaries from Bethlehem, PA, and American and British companies like Standard Fruit moved into the area. Along with the foreign companies and the missionaries came small businessmen-many of them Britons, Germans, and Americans-who settled in the interior of the Rio Coco. They settled into the region, married Indian women, and set up trading posts, ranches, boat yards, and lumber supply areas along the river. These people, called &quot;bamboo whites&quot; by the Marines, shipped raw wood from inside Nicaragua to sawmills located at Puerto Cabezas on the coast. Both politically and economically, they would prove critical in the war with Sandino.\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result of all these developments-missionary activity, the development of foreign owned &quot;big businesses&quot; along the coast, and the addition of a new strata of &quot;bamboo businessmen&quot; to the area's social structure-the Miskito remained more connected to the United States and the English-speaking Caribbean than to Hispanic Nicaragua. But if local history and economics pushed the coast in one direction, geopolitics moved it in another. Backed by pressure from the United States, Great Britain dropped the coast from protectorate status and officially ceded the area to Nicaragua in 1860. Since Nicaragua was too weak to exercise its claim, the coast remained in political limbo for decades until Nicaraguan President Jose Santos Zelaya sent troops into the area to capture Bluefields in 1894.\r\n<br>\r\nDespite military occupation by Spanish-speaking troops, the Indians continued to resent the Nicaraguans. The inhabitants of the coast also kept looking to Great Britain for support (several British and American businessmen did sell them arms).  In 1894, the Miskito Reserve was dissolved — &quot;reincorporated&quot; into the Nicaraguan state — which led to a local uprising that was eventually quelled by the US Marines. \r\n<br>\r\nIn the years following the 1894 takeover, Black Creoles and Miskito Indians would pepper the British Foreign Office with petitions that asked the British to retake their territory, a tradition that would continue until the late 1950s. This fraught relationship with the Nicaraguan government would lead to troubles well into the 1980s.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	1894	1894	2	58		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:48.996392	2015-02-13 04:07:48.996392	\N

He also put his personal stamp on everything. On village water pumps: &quot;Trujillo alone gives us water to drink.&quot; On a home for the aged: &quot;Trujillo is the only one who gives us shelter.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nTrujillo won the 1930 presidential election with more votes than there were registered voters, but as long as he was anti-communist, Washington was happy, so he invoked anti-communism to justify mass deportations, torture and summary execution. \r\nWorkers who asked for wage increases were labelled &quot;communists&quot; and shot on the spot, as were farmers who tried to stop Trujillo from confiscating their land. He eventually controlled over 80% of the country's sugar plantations, using slave labor provided by neighboring Haiti to keep profits high, but in 1937 he decided to blame depressed sugar prices on the Haitian workers and massacred 20,000 of them. Trujillo was finally assassinated by the CIA in 1961, after he attempted to have President Romulo Betancourt of Venezuela murdered because of his criticism of Trujillo's brutal regime (this was after a failed attempt to attack revolutionary Cuba). It was only then that the Marine Corps made public the fact that our &quot;ally&quot; Trujillo was a convicted rapist!\r\n<br>\r\n Highlights of the Trujillo era include the policy of blanquismo (whitening) and the massacre of 20-25,000 Haitians.\r\n</p><p class="entry columns" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n<strong>Some Interesting Facts</strong><br>\r\nAt the suggestion of Mario Fermin Cabral, Congress voted overwhelmingly in 1936 to rename the capital from Santo Domingo to Ciudad Trujillo. The province of San Cristobal was created as &quot;Trujillo,&quot; and the nation's highest peak, Pico Duarte, was renamed in his honor. Statues of &quot;El Jefe&quot; were mass-produced and erected across the Republic, and bridges and public buildings were named in his honor. The nation's newspapers now had praise for Trujillo as part of the front page, and license plates included the slogan &quot;Viva Trujillo!&quot; An electric sign was erected in Ciudad Trujillo so that &quot;Dios y Trujillo&quot; could be seen at night as well as in the day. Eventually, even churches were required to post the slogan, &quot;Dios en cielo, Trujillo en tierra&quot; (<i>God in Heaven, Trujillo on Earth</i>). Trujillo was recommended for the Nobel Peace Prize by his admirers, but the committee declined the suggestion. When he received (or summoned) a visitor, his four bodyguards would have submachine guns trained upon the &quot;guest&quot; during the meeting.\r\n</p>	1930	1961	1	38		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:49.29442	2015-02-13 04:07:49.29442	\N

Marti, who had spent many years raising funds and support from Cuban and leftist communities in the United States and Spain, is killed on May 19th of 1895. By 1898, the revolutionaries controlled half the island despite the 200,000 Spanish troops sent against them. That year, the US sent the warship USS Maine to Havana. Its explosion, which killed 258 troops aboard, remains a mystery to this day, but was used as grounds by President William McKinley to attack. US troops were sent to other Spanish colonies, including Puerto Rico and the Philippines where their own wars of independence were under way. The United States took both of the latter countries as colonies, killing hundreds of thousands of local rebels in the ensuing years, and in December of 1898, took it upon itself to sign the Treaty of Paris with Spain which recognized Cuban independence. Of course, no Cuban was involved in the signing. </p>	1895	1898	6	32		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:49.003587	2015-02-13 04:07:49.003587	\N

234	"Race War"	<p class="entry columns">Along with a handful of supporters, Evaristo Estenoz and black journalist Gregorio Surin founded the &quot;Agrupacion Independiente de Color&quot; in Havana on August 7 1908 (the name was later changed to &quot;Partido Independiente de Color&quot; or  &quot;Independence Movement by People of Color&quot;). At the end of the month they began to publish the newspaper <i>Prevision</i>.\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="../mapimages/Partido_de_Color_de_Cuba.png" style="padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;">\r\n<span class="caption"> Members of the Movement</span>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir goal was to advocate for Afro-Cuban integration into mainstream society with equal participation in government. Their platform demanded an end to racial discrimination, equal access to education and government jobs by Afro-Cubans and an end to the ban on &quot;non-white&quot; immigration. Additional demands tried to improve the conditions of all Cubans: the expansion of compulsory free education from 8 to 14 years, abolition of the death penalty, establishment of an 8-hr work day and priority for Cubans in employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n&quot;Our motto is 'Cuba for the Cubans,'&quot; said an editorial in <i>Prevision</i> on September 15 1908.\r\n<br>\r\nIn May 1909, while serving as President of the Cuban Senate, Morua Delgado introduced a law in the senate that banned political parties based on race or class. This was a direct attack on the Partido Independiente de Color, and was known as the Morua Law.\r\n<br>\r\nThree years later a demonstration sponsored by the Independientes grew into demonstrations in which Afro-Cubans attacked and burned foreign-owned properties.  In May of 1912, PIC organizers launched an armed demonstration seeking legalization in time for November's elections.  Government forces, fearing an all-out &quot;race war&quot; and hoping to rid it of a prominent political adversary, subsequently launched an armed campaign against the party, massacring an estimated 6,000 Afro-Cubans.  Among the dead included party leaders, rank-and-file members, and ordinary Afro-Cuban peasants who had no ties to the PIC. \r\nDuring the uprising, US Marines land and two US battleships anchor in Havana harbor but the Taft administration maintains this does not constitute intervention.\r\n<br>\r\nThe assault resulted in the final demise of the party and a warning to black Cubans who sought to challenge the structure of power established and maintained by white Cuba. &quot;The movement was crushed immediately everywhere except in Oriente, especially Guantanamo region,&quot; wrote Hugh Thomas in <i>Cuba, or The Pursuit of Freedom</i>. &quot;The alarm was nevertheless immense, Havana being overwhelmed by panic. Everyone had feared a 'Negro uprising' for years. The atmosphere resembled the 'Great Fear' in the French Revolution.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	1908	1912	7	32	J.A.

238	Knox's war on Zelaya	<p>\r\n<strong>1910 Marines land in Bluefields and Corinto.</strong><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:normal;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:7px;">\r\n<i>Some Context…</i><br>\r\nFrom 1890 to 1899 US forces invaded Nicaragua three more times. In\r\n1896 marines attacked Corimo to 'protect American interests during\r\npolitical unrest'; in 1898 US troops landed at San Juan del Sur; in 1899\r\nthey were in action in Bluefields and San Juan del Norte, all under the\r\nrubric of 'protecting American lives and bridges'. Nicaraguans should\r\nhave understood by this time that people in Washington, not Managua,\r\nwould control their destiny.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/josesantoszelaya.jpg" class="floatleft">\r\n\r\nNevertheless, some Nicaraguans took sovereignty seriously. In the\r\nearly 1900s Nicaraguan President Jose Samos Zelaya (who assumed\r\ndictatorial powers) committed a bold and, as it turned out, rather\r\nimprudent act. \r\nThis crusty authoritarian nationalist refused to cede to\r\nthe United States exclusive rights to build a canal, which would have\r\nincluded US control of a strip of Nicaraguan territory. Instead, he invited\r\nEuropean and Japanese concerns to aid in building an interoceanic link\r\nto connect the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. He also asked the Bank of\r\nEngland - not a New York bank - for a loan.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\nUS Secretary of State Philander C. Knox took umbrage. Highly\r\nconscious of the Monroe Doctrine and the Roosevelt Corrolary to\r\nthat document, which asserted US 'international police power' in the\r\nhemisphere, Knox branded Zelaya's moves as opening the door to\r\n'European infiltration'. He angrily denounced the Nicaraguan president\r\nfor even daring to think about entering into financial transactions with\r\nany but US banks. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKnox's subsequent demands on the Nicaraguan\r\ngovernment belied even the thinnest respect for its sovereignty: a ninety-nine\r\nyear lease for a naval base on the Gulf of Fonseca and permanent\r\naccess rights for a canal through Nicaragua. In words that presaged\r\nReagan administration rhetoric some seventy years later, Philander Knox,\r\nin 1909, accused Zelaya of '<i>keeping Central America in tension and\r\nturmoil</i>'.\r\n<br>\r\nThe stubborn Zelaya, taking seriously the fiction of Nicaraguan\r\nindependence, refused to accede to Knox's commands. The US government retaliated by destabilizing his regime. During the course of\r\nsubverting Zelaya's government, two US secret agents were caught <i>in\r\nflagrante delicto</i> trying to dynamite Nicaraguan bridges. Zelaya ordered\r\nthem to be tried. Despite US protestations, they were convicted and\r\nshot. Knox used the incident to sever diplomatic relations and send\r\nmarines to Bluefields.\r\n<br>\r\nKnox's plan worked. As was the case in subsequent episodes of\r\ndestablization, the government and the private sector cooperated. United\r\nFruit Company donated $1 million toward the overthrow of the Zelaya\r\ngovernment. \r\n\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/philandercknox.jpg" class="floatright">\r\n\r\nZelaya was forced into exile and replaced by Adolfo Diaz\r\nwho, obedient to Washington's commands, canceled concessions to\r\nnon-US firms and opened the door to the exaggerated claims of US\r\nbanks, which then transferred to their own coffers more than half of\r\nNicaragua's national bank assets. In 1914, as the Panama Canal opened\r\nto ships crossing between the Atlantic and Pacific, President Diaz made\r\nan offer to the United States: S3 million in exchange for 'rights in\r\nperpetuity' to any land needed to build a canal through the San Juan\r\nroute in southern Nicaragua. The $3 million was handled by US-appointed\r\ncommissioners to repay foreign loans, mostly to US banks,\r\nso that a mere pittance actually found its way into the Nicaraguan\r\nTreasury. The canal was never built, but the United States acquired a\r\nrenewable lease for a naval base on the Corn Islands and on the Gulf\r\nof Fonseca.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<span class="caption">President Zelaya, <I>pictured with moustache</i>; Secretary of State Philander C.

241	The 20-year occupation fighting guerrillas of Augusto Sandino	<p class="entry columns">\r\nThe Mexican Revolution taught American policy makers that Latin American economic nationalism was a force to be reckoned with. The hit-and-run guerrilla war tactics of Augusto Sandino, who between 1927 and 1933 fought the U.S. Marines in Nicaragua to a\r\ndraw, further taught them that political nationalism was an equally powerful force and that attempts to counter it with increased militarism would only lead to a deterioration of American influence. U.S. troops had been in and out of Nicaragua a number of times\r\nsince the late nineteenth century. In 1916 Calvin Coolidge, who despite his charisma deficit fancied himself a robust expansionist in the Theodore Roosevelt mold, once again dispatched an expedition, this time to quell a budding civil war but also to sequester the kind of revolutionary nationalism that was spreading throughout Mexico. His actions backfired.\r\n<br>\r\nDespite overwhelming asymmetrical firepower, including advances in aerial warfare, Nicaragua proved to be the United States's first third-world quagmire. Sandino harassed the Americans not just with attack-and-retreat guerrilla tactics that inflicted a deadly toll\r\nbut with ideas. As head of a self-styled Defending Army of Nicaraguan National Sovereignty, the rebel leader̵ who took as his official seal an image of a peasant with a raised machete about to decapitate a captured marine—tapped into widespread Latin American resentment. His brand of patriotism esteemed the dark-skinned, impoverished peasant culture that prevailed throughout Mesoamerica and much of South America, while vilifying not only Yankees but their well-heeled local allies, or, as Sandino called them, <i>vendepatrias</i>—country sellers. &quot;Pro-Nicaraguan committees&quot; sprang up throughout Latin America, with Sandino's David-against-Goliath struggle coming to embody a century of aggression and arrogance. Manifestos,  grassroots meetings, editorials, and ever larger street protests denounced Washington's war in Nicaragua. Newspapers published regular articles on the crisis and ran photographs provided by Sandino of captured, executed, and mutilated marines, contributing to a sense of U.S. vulnerability. His appeal extended to the United States, where he coordinned his public relations campaign with the activities of the All-American Anti-Imperialist League, sending his brother Socrates on a national speaking tour. In Europe, a Mexican delegate to the 1929 International Congress against Colonialism and Imperialism waved a tattered American flag captured by Sandino's troops to a loud round of cheers and applause. Even London, then in the process of spreading its control over much of the Middle East, took great pleasure re in condemning America's actions as &quot;frankly imperialistic.&quot;\r\n<br>\r\nTensions came to a head at the Sixth Pan-American Conference, held in Havana in early 1928. By the time of the meeting, pan-Americanism, the idea that the American republics shared common ideals and political interests, was in effect moribund. But it was trotted out every few years in an international forum where Latin American delegates mostly submitted to Washington's directives while silently seething about the latest violation of national sovereignty—in Panama, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Venezuela, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, take your pick. Proceedings in Havana moved according to script. The closing ceremony was not intended for debate, yet El Salvador raised the issue of Washington's military interventions, opening the floodgates of criticism. The gallery audience applauded each recounting of old and new grievances and hissed at the tepid defense of US. policy offered by its envoy. This court rebellion took place in the shadow of Sandino's war, which on the eve of the conference had scored a number of impressive victories. The rebel was not directly mentioned, although one Latin American daily after another read the diplomacy in light of the fighting in Nicaragua. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	1912	1933	7	98	Empire's Workshop, Greg Grandin	large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:49.079914	2015-02-13 04:07:49.079914	\N

244	National City Bank	<p class="entry columns" style="padding-top:10px;"><i>National City Bank (now Citibank) opens its first South American branch, after having financed projects by US firms like General Electric there and elsewhere in the continent.</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General Electric Company operated in a new science based industry where technology played a critically important role. G.E. relied on protection of its patent rights to control markets and bar other entrants into the industry. These characteristics of the industry pushed G.E. into Latin America. When G.E. began to invest directly in overseas power generation, particularly in Latin America, it formed the <i>American and Foreign Power Company</i> (AFP) to manage those assets, During the 1920s, AFP expanded its operations to eleven Latin American countries, investing a  total of $500 million. As a result of these steps, G.E. could control markets and technologies in Latin America through its direct ownership of power generating companies in countries like Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, and Chile. Meanwhile, banks and investment firms became an inevitable part of this corporate thrust into Latin America.\r\n<br>\r\nHolding seats on many of the boards of these corporations and serving as critical sources of financing, firms such as J. P. Morgan and James Stillman's National City Bank soon became deeply involved in Latin America. Morgan and National City Bank provided financing for such corporations as American Smelting and Refining and General Electric. National City Bank also moved directly into South America by opening its first branch in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1913, followed by the establishment of branches in Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, and Cuba. U.S. financial institutions soon added to these activities by purchasing interest bearing bonds sold by Latin American governments as a means of generating loans. In fact, Morgan, National City, and other U.S. banking houses formed a South\r\nAmerican Group, sharing these loan offerings among themselves and British bankers. Of course, U.S. enterprise brought more than technology and capital to Latin America; their version of U.S. culture and the objective of spreading it far and wide in the Western Hemisphere were also an essential part of the package.\r\n<br>\r\nWhile an earlier generation of U.S. businesspeople had brought to Latin America a faith in their version of Protestantism and their republican form of government, this new generation of the entrepreneurial elite shared a grander vision and ambitions. Central to this vision "was the notion that the United States must assume the burdens of uplifting the Latin populace so that they could join in helping to fulfill the New World's unique destinies." The business elite grounded that idea in pseudoscientific racist philosophies. Those philosophies asserted that there were measurable physiological differences between humans, which created a hierarchy of superior and inferior races. Yet many U.S. business leaders who ascribed to these theories also believed that the citizens of civilized societies could reform and uplift the denizens of barbarian nations. In this manner, American racist beliefs defined Latin America as a series of backward, largely uncivilized societies, but capable of advancing to higher levels with U.S. assistance. U.S. business leaders would play perhaps the most important role in this new mission to reform and uplift the supposedly backward peoples of Latin America.<br>\r\n\r\nThe U.S. corporate mission of reform included a commitment to the reorganization of the work place-an essential aspect of the second industrial revolution. Such commitment meant training Latin American workers and middle class employees, not merely in specific skills, but in basic values of competitiveness, individualism, respect for professional qualifications, punctuality, and so forth. Yet this ambitious corporate program of Americanization in Latin American societies could not have advanced without the support of Latin American elites.\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	1913	1913	5	3	The Century of U.S. Capitalism in Latin America by thomas f.

Nor in Paraguay, as we have seen;\r\nbut the railroads built by the Paraguayan state, with the help of European\r\ntechnicians, passed into British hands after the defeat. The other countries'\r\nrailroads went the same way without producing a single centavo of new\r\ninvestment; furthermore, the state contracts took care to assure the companies a\r\nminimum profit level, to avoid possible unpleasant surprises. Decades later, at\r\nthe end of World War II, when the railroads yielded no more dividends and had\r\nfallen into relative disuse, the public authorities got them back. Almost all of\r\nthe states bought the scrap iron from the British and thus nationalized the\r\ncompanies' losses.\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the railroads were booming, the British concerns had often obtained\r\nconsiderable land concessions on either side of the tracks, in addition to the\r\nrailbeds themselves and the right to build new branch lines. The land was an\r\nadditional business bonanza. A fabulous gift to the Brazilian railway in 1911\r\nled to the burning of countless huts and the eviction or death of peasant\r\nfamilies in the concession area. It was this that triggered off the &quot;Contestado&quot;\r\nrevolt, one of the greatest outbursts of popular fury in Brazilian history.</i>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Contestado movement occurred in the south of the country in a\r\nfrontier area disputed by the states of Parana and Santa Catarina. It began\r\nin 1911 under the leadership of Jose Maria, who died in the first clashes\r\nand was heralded as a saint by the rebels of the Contestado. Unlike\r\nCanudos, the movement did not limit itself to one particular centre, but\r\nshifted to various points in the region, under pressure from military\r\nforces. The rebellion was put down in late 1915, when rebel strongholds\r\nwere attacked and destroyed by 6,000 soldiers from the army and the\r\npolice force, assisted by 1,000 civilians who joined in the process of\r\nrepression.\r\n<br>\r\nIn considering the principal social movements in the interior of Brazil\r\nduring the First Republic, Joazeiro, a city in the south of the state of\r\nCeara, which became the centre of activities of the priest Cicero Romao\r\nBatista between 1872 and 1924, also deserves mention. There are many\r\ncommon features between events in Joazeiro and the Canudos and\r\nContestado movements. For example, from the point of view of the\r\nhistory of the transformation of the Catholic church in Brazil, particularly\r\nin the north-east, Canudos and Joazeiro were manifestations of similar developments.\r\nOn the other hand, when considering social movements as\r\nmanifestations of rebellion, Joazeiro has little in common with the other\r\ntwo movements. Although Padre Cicero clashed continuously with the\r\necclesiastical authorities, and at times with factions of the oligarchy, his\r\nmovement for better or worse fell within the system of domination\r\nwhich prevailed during the First Republic. Put simply, the city of\r\nJoazeiro can be seen as an area controlled by a <i>priest-coronel</i>, who had a\r\nconsiderable degree of influence within the political oligarchy, particularly\r\nafter 1909 when Padre Cicero began to involve himself directly in\r\nthe political struggles.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="another page"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\nThe Canudos and Contestado movements were attempts to create an\r\nalternative way of life, and were considered sufficiently dangerous for\r\nboth to be brutally crushed by military forces. This does not mean that\r\nthey were totally opposed to the power structure of the coronets. Before\r\nsettling in Canudos, Antonio Conselheiro had been a practising member\r\nof the Catholic church, living an ascetic, nomadic life. He summoned\r\nthe people together in order to build or rebuild churches. He built\r\nwalls around cemeteries, and he showed concern for the small parish\r\nchurches of the interior. There is evidence that at this stage he was well\r\nlooked upon by certain coronets, for whom his disciplined followers built\r\nroads and dams. The village of Canudos itself did not depart very much\r\nfrom the traditional pattern of settlement in the interior. There was a\r\ncertain degree of social and economic differentiation, a considerable\r\ndegree of trade with the surrounding area, and religious links with the\r\npriests of the neighbouring parishes. Canudos was also a source of votes\r\nand influence at election time.\r\n<br>\r\nThe instigators of the Contesdado movement were the followers of a\r\ncoronet who was a member of the opposition and seen as a friend of the\r\npoor. Others of varying origins joined this group, among them those\r\nwho were the victims of the process of modernization in both urban and\r\nrural areas: rural workers driven off the land by the construction of a\r\nrailway and a timber plant, people who had been recruited for railway\r\nconstruction from among the unemployed of large cities and then\r\nabandoned at the end of their contract, and criminals who were at large in\r\nthe region. However, the village settlements which grew up during the\r\nContestado, with their emphasis on equality and fraternity, clashed with\r\nestablished social values, and assumed characteristics which were clearly\r\nmessianic. This can be seen, among other features, through the way\r\nmany of the members of the Contestado remained loyal to the monarchy\r\nwhich, it has been argued, represented an eschatological kingdom more\r\nthan a political institution. The theme of the monarchy, whether\r\nbecause of the form it took or because of the period in which the\r\nContestado movement occurred, was not exploited to any extent by the\r\ngovernment. In contrast, the earlier monarchism of Antonio\r\nConselheiro, with its attacks on the Republic, responsible for the\r\nintroduction of civil marriage and for the taking of cemeteries away from\r\nthe control of the church, took more concrete forms. As a result it was a\r\nmobilizing factor against Canudos in the urban centres, at a time when\r\nthe possibility of the restoration of the monarchy was seen as a real threat.\r\nCanudos, Contestado and Joazeiro were not episodes devoid of\r\nsignificance, nor were they isolated expressions by an ignorant rural\r\npopulation in contrast to the centres of civilization on the coast. In\r\ndifferent degrees, these movements can be linked to changes in the\r\nCatholic church, to socio-economic changes in their respective areas, and\r\nto the political development of the nation itself. Their particular strength\r\nas a demonstration of popular religious belief cannot be ignored.\r\nNevertheless, as attempts at independent organization on the part of the\r\nrural population, they effectively illustrate the severe limitations of such\r\norganization during the period of the First Republic.\r\n</p>	1914	1916	6	15		large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:49.102689	2015-02-13 04:07:49.102689	\N

The resistance is organized by the Cacos and led by Charlemagne Peralte, until his murder by a U.S. Marine officer. After his murder, the U.S. Military circulates pictures of his corpse tied to a door to intimidate sympathizers, but it has the opposite effect, making Peralte, killed at 33, into a martyr.\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="../mapimages/haitiperaltesamidcacos.jpg" style="padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;"><br>\r\n<span class="caption"> Charlemagne Peralte, center, with Cacos</span>\r\n<br>\r\nMarine Commander Thorpe told new Marine arrivals that the war would last long enough \r\n<i>&quot;to give every man a chance against the Hun in Europe as against the Hun in Santo Domingo.&quot;</i> \r\nThe hand of the Huns was particularly evident in Haiti, he explained: \r\n&quot;Whoever is running this revolution is a wise man; he certainly is getting a lot out of the n——-s . . .

256	The Tragic Week and the Patagonian Tragedy	<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:75%">The urban working class found little in common with the middle class.\nThey resented the economic privileges of factory owners, landholders,\nand exporters, as well as the Radical party's patronage of the middle\nclass. Strikes became more disruptive as industry attempted to deal with\nmaterial shortages caused by World War I. The war disrupted coal imports\nfrom England, forcing industry to operate at reduced levels. Railway\ncompanies struggled to maintain schedules while imports plunged. Real\nwages fell between 1914 and 1917 by a third as shortages forced industries\nto dismiss workers. Use of agricultural wastes compressed into briquettes\nfor heating and cooking symbolized wartime hardships and the decline\nin living standards. Frustrated workers clashed with factory owners\nas strikes became violent. Employers with links with vigilante groups\nformed the Labor Association (Asociacion del Trabajo) to break strikes with\nreplacement workers. The meatpacking strike of December 1917 ended\nbloodily, as the police stormed union headquarters armed with sabers\nslashing anyone unlucky enough to be in the way. A railroad strike earlier\nin the year resulted in damaged and burned equipment. The government\nusually intervened against strikes mounted by supposed radicals,\nwhile moderate union leaders often received President Yrigoyen's support. In the\ncase of the rail strike the president imposed a generous contract on the\ncompanies, including an eight-hour day, annual paid vacations, and sick\nand overtime pay. Yrigoyen's tactics undercut the Socialists and pushed\nthe Anarchists into confrontation, with grim consequences. Two violent\nclashes, the January 1919 Semana Tragica (Tragic Week) and the Patagonia\nTragica (1921-1922), rank among the worst labor disturbances of the early\ntwentieth century.\n<br>\nThe Semana Tragica began with a strike against a metalwork factory by\nan Anarchist union late in 1918. Fighting broke out between strikebreakers\nand workers. Heavy-handed police tactics added to the violence.\nOver the course of the next several diays, events spun out of control. \nThe Anarchist Labor Federntion's call for a genernl strike provided the pretext\nfor vigilantes, who subsequently provided the core of Liga Patriotica\nArgentina (Argentine Patriotic League). Thugs swept into the Jewish\nbarrio of Buenos Aires (popular perceptions associated Jews with\nAnarchists) and by the time the destruction ended, 700 to 1,500 people\ndied and another 4,000 had been beaten or injured. The army, without\norders from the president, assumed control of the capital. Property damage\nand lost production and wages cast the economy millions of pesos.\nYrigoyen offered to arbitrate between the parties. In the end, an alarmed\ngovernment forced the company to settle the strike. Lingering police and\nvigilante violence slowly played itself out and the Semana Tragica ended.\nUpper class perceptions that the government lacked the will or ability to\ndiscipline workers resul ted in the forma tion of the Liga Patriotica Argentina.\nThe LPA responded to fears that foreign ideologies, and labor organiziltions\ninfluenced by them, would shred the social fabric and damage the\neconomy. Manuel Carles established the League in 1919 with the idea of\nusing physical force to root out radicals. Organized as a paramilitary organization,\nthe LPA drew much of its leadership from the Jockey Club. The\nleague's mission to indoctrinate the working class to counter radicalism\nhad the support of the Church, the elite, and the middle class. A female\ndivision labored to bring the League's message to working-women. While\nthe upper and middle classes becnme more concerned, labor became\nincreasingly desperate and militant.\n<br>\nIn Patagonia, violence came on the heels of a momentary improvement\nin working conditions. In late 1920, employers, mainly British sheep operators,\norganized as the Sociedad Rural de Santa Cruz, responded positively\nto demands for better wnges and conditions. Workers wanted a limit\non the number of occupants per hut, a mattress for each person, and\nsalaries in hard currency to protect the value of wages. Unfortunately, a\ndrop in the price of wool on world markets led to deterioration of labor\nand living conditions. A general strike drew a sharp line between owners\nand workers. The issue cnme down to which side would bear the\nburden of hard times. Angry workers seized property, while landowners\nformed white guards to defend their interests. Local Radical party officials\nsided with the owners. Unbalanced reports picked up by the press\npresented an alarmist and distorted picture. After local muscle failed to\nbreak the strike, the army arrived in early 1921, believing that it faced an\nAnarchist insurrection. The Tenth Cavalry, commanded by Lt. Colonel\nHector Varela assisted by LPA members, shot suspected Anarchists in\ncold blood, tortured strikers, and dumped their bodies into mass graves.\nAfter some 2,000 victims, the strike collapsed. In a gruesome aftermath,\nColonel Varela died in a bomb blast, his assassin subsequently murdered\nby a guard, who then in turn died violently: a chain of death that shook\nthe nation.</p>	1921	1922	10	3	Argentina: What Went Wrong\n By Colin M.

257	The Lieutenants	<p class="entry columns">In many ways Brazil's hyper-federal political system failed to govern a country that was undergoing rapid social and economic change. With an impractical constitution and archaic institutions, the government could barely keep pace with the nation's progress, let alone solve its burgeoning problems. By the 1920s the tensions caused by government ineffectiveness erupted into major challenges to the state. \r\nFar and away the biggest challenge was a series of military rebellions called the Tenente Revolts (<i>tenente</i> means &quot;lieutenant&quot; in Portuguese). Civil-military relations had not been smooth since the early days of the Old Republic, and in 1922 several hundred officer cadets seized army installations to demand reforms. Their revolt was put down brutally, and those who survived were jailed or fled into exile. In 1924 the cadets captured the capital of Sao Paulo and held it for nearly a month to protest their mistreatment and blocked aspirations. When dislodged, they embarked on the Great March through the Brazilian backlands, which eventually covered 24,000 kilo-meters and lasted over 2 years. The rebels disbanded in early 1927, but their cry for reforms left a potent impression on educated Brazilians.</p>	1922	1927	6	16		large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:49.231765	2015-02-13 04:07:49.231765	\N

260	The high point of militancy of Panamanian organized labor in this period was reached in 1925.	<p class="entry ">In 1924, a number of young leaders of the Federacion Obrera, who were organized in the Grupo Comunista, had broken away to establish the Sindica to General de Trabajadores (SGT). It organized several new unions, but more importantly, established the Liga de Inquilinos (Tenants' League). That organization conducted an extensive campaign to lower rents in the cities of Panama. This culminated in a general rent strike in Panama City, which was marked by considerable violence.

276	Catavi Massacre and MNR repression	<p class="entry columns">The United States's problem of combating &quot;subversion&quot; had come to the fore in 1943, when Bolivian mine owners called on government troops to suppress striking tin miners, killing hundreds of them in the &quot;Catavi massacre.&quot; There was no US reaction until the nationalist, anti-oligarchic, pro-labor National Revolutionary Movement (MNR) deposed the dictatorship a year later. The US denounced the new regime as &quot;pro-fascist&quot; (on flimsy pretexts) and as opposed to &quot;Anglo-Yankee imperialism&quot; (accurately, in this case), demanded that all MNR members be excluded from positions of power, and quickly secured its overthrow in favor of a military government. A State Department memo identified one decisive theme: the mine owners, it observed, are afraid of the MNR's &quot;announced intention to interest itself in the betterment of the workers, fearing this can only be done at the expense of the mining interests.&quot;</p>	1943	1944	10	13	Year 501, Chomsky	large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:49.331896	2015-02-13 04:07:49.331896	\N

In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.&quot; \r\n<br>Two years later, Butler blows the whistle on the Business Plot, an attempt by Wall Street barons to enlist Butler into leading a fascist coup in the United States. </p>\r\n<p class="entry" style="width:450px;">For more about Smedley Butler, \r\n<br>\r\ncheck out his book,"<a href="http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/warracket.html" class="inline" target="_blank">War is a Racket.</a>"</p>	1931	1931	1	74		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:49.369766	2015-02-13 04:07:49.369766	\N

It was then Reagan renewed tolerance and acceptance of the extreme right which led to the emergence of the National Republican Alliance, ARENA, and the rise of ex-Major Roberto D’Aubuisson.<br>\r\nARENA is a violent Fascist party modeled after the Nazis and certain revolutionary Communist groups. . . . The founders and chief supporters of ARENA are rich Salvadoran exiles headquartered in Miami and civilian activists in El Salvador. ARENA’S military arm comprises officers and men of the Salvadoran Army and security forces. . . . My Embassy devoted considerable resources to identifying the sources of rightwing violence and their contacts in Miami, Florida. . . . the Miami Six explained . . . that to rebuild the country, it must ﬁrst be destroyed totally, the economy must be wrecked, unemployment must be massive, the junta must be ousted and a “good” military oﬁcer brought to power who will carry out a total cleansing—<i>limpieza</i>—killing 3 or 4 or 500,000 people. . . .

UN ambassador-designate Jeane Kirkpatrick insisted, “the nuns were not just nuns” but FMLN “political activists.” Secretary of State Alexander Haig called them “<i>pistol-packing nuns</i>” and suggested to a congressional committee that “perhaps the vehicle the nuns were riding in may have tried to run a roadblock.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Power"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry"  style="color:white;">\r\n<strong>The Real Power in El Salvador</strong>\r\nIn the common meanings of the ted, they are the government of the country.

290	Not Hearts and Minds, But Stomachs and Livers	<div class="page" data-title="Hearts"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\n&emsp;\r\nThe CIA was established in 1947—the same year Washington served notice that its support for Latin American democracy was conditional on the maintenance of order—and began to develop contacts among military officers, religious leaders, and politicians it identified as bulwarks of stability. Yet it was not until 1954 that it would execute its first full-scale covert operation in Latin America, overthrowing Guatemalan president Jacobo Arbenz and installing a more pliant successor. Arbenz, as CIA analysts and most historians today admit, was trying to implement a New Deal-style economic program to modernize and humanize Guatemala's brutal plantation economy. His only crime was to expropriate, <i>with full compensation</i>, uncultivated United Fruit Company land and legalize the Communist Party—both unacceptable acts from Washington's early-1950s vantage point.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOperation PRSUCCESS, as the CIA called its Guatemalan campaign, was the agency's most comprehensive covert action to date, much more ambitious than its operations in postwar Italy and France or in Iran the year before. Unlike the ouster of the Iranian prime minister, Mohammad Mossadeq, which took a mere couple of weeks, Arbenz's overthrow required nearly a year.  \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn addition to destabilizing Guatemala's economy, isolating the country diplomatically through the OAS, and training a mercenary force in Honduras, the Guatemalan campaign gave CIA operatives the chance to try out new psych-war techniques gleaned from behavioral social sciences. They worked with local agents to plant stories in the Guatemalan and U.S. press, engineer death threats, and conduct a bombing campaign—all designed to generate anxiety and uncertainty. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="../mapimages/ciaguatemalagasolinedepot.jpg" style="padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;"><br>&emsp;\r\n<span class="caption"> Gasoline depot bombed by CIA rebel air force</span>\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThey organized phantom groups, such as the &quot;Organization of Militant Godless,&quot; and spread rumors that the government was going to ban Holy Week, exile the archbishop, confiscate bank accounts, expropriate all private property, and force children into reeducation centers. Operatives studied pop sociologies and grifter novels and worked closely with <a href="http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/bernprop.html"  target="_blank" class="inline">Edward Bernays &#10063;</a>, a pioneer in public propaganda (and Sigmund Freud's nephew), to apply disinformation tactics. Borrowing from Orson Welles's War of the Worlds, they transmitted radio shows—taped in Florida and beamed in from Nicaragua—that made it seem as if a widespread underground resistance movement were gaining strength; they even managed to stage on-the-air battles.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Livers"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\n&emsp;\r\nIn the 1950s, the Cold War was often presented as a battle of ideas, yet CIA agents on the ground didn't see it that way. They rejected the advice of their Guatemalan allies that the campaign include an educational component, instead insisting on a strategy intended to inspire fear more than virtue. Propaganda designed to &quot;attack the theoretical foundations of the enemy&quot; was misplaced, one field operative wrote; psychological efforts should be directed at the &quot;heart, the stomach and the liver (fear).&quot; We are not running a popularity contest but an uprising,&quot; rejoined one agent to Guatemalan concerns that the campaign was too negative. U.S. planes flew low over the capital, dropping propaganda material, which for a region that hadn't seen aerial warfare since the marine campaign against Sandino sent a message beyond what was printed on the flyers. &quot;I\r\nsuppose it doesn't really matter what the leaflets say,&quot; said Tracy Barnes, who led the operation.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n<span style="background-color:#cc0000; font-size:1.2em;">The &quot;most effective leaflet drops during the operations,&quot;</span> concluded a CIA postmortem of the coup, <span style="background-color:#cc0000; font-size:1.2em;">&quot;were those followed by a successful military blow.&quot; Such blows were delivered by CIA assets in country, who bombed roads, bridges, military installations, and property owned by government supporters.</span> The agency distributed sabotage manuals that provided illustrated, step-by-step instructions on how to make pipe bombs, time bombs, remote fuses, chemical, nitroglycerine, and dynamite bombs, even explosives hidden in pens, books, and rocks. A how-to guide exhorted Guatemalans to take up violence in the name of liberty, noting that &quot;sabotage, like all things in life, is good or bad depending on whether its objective is good or bad.&quot; Such a &quot;terror program&quot; worked. Arbenz fell not because psych ops had won the hearts and minds of the population but because the military refused to defend him, fearing Washington's wrath if it repelled the mercenaries.\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAt least some American leaders were fully aware that the Guatemalan intervention marked a watershed in inter-American relations, and they did their best to limit its damage. Assistant Secretary of State Mann, for example, admitted in a private memo that CIA efforts to oust Arbenz represented Washington's first full-scale &quot;violation of the Non-intervention Agreement,&quot; the &quot;first of its kind since the establishment of the Good Neighbor Policy.&quot; Yet he hoped to hold on to the idea of the Good Neighbor policy, even as the United States corrupted its language and institutions. He therefore gave instructions that each step in the coup &quot;should be justified on technical grounds&quot; to allow the United States to claim plausibly that it was acting within the letter, if not the spirit, of Roosevelt's nonintervention pledge.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nBut on the heels of Guatemala came Cuba in 1959, a revolution that the CIA found itself powerless to reverse—even though it modeled its 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, which sought to topple Castro, on its earlier successful Guatemalan operation. Cuban revolutionaries learned well from the Guatemalan experience. Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara in fact was in Guatemala in 1954, having concluded his famous motorcycle tour of South America to work as a young, socially conscious doctor. He witnessed firsthand the effects of U.S. intervention, taking refuge in the Argentine embassy, where he would meet a number of other future Latin American revolutionaries. After a time cooling his heels, he won safe passage to Mexico, where he joined Fidel Castro's revolutionary movement in exile. &quot;Cuba will not be Guatemala,&quot; he liked to taunt Washington.\r\n</p>	1954	1954	1	44	Empire's Workshop, Greg Grandin	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:49.555255	2015-02-13 04:07:49.555255	\N
291	Paraguay's Fascist Dictator (1954 - 1989)	<p class="entry columns" style="background-color:white;padding:15px;width:530px;position:absolute;left:0px;top:45px;">Stroessner seized power in 1954, after leading a golpe de estado against President Federico Chavez. His subsequent decades as the perpetual leader of the Asociacion Nacional Republicana/Partido Colorado were characterized by massive corruption, endemic human rights abuses and systematic acts of violence against purported &quot;enemies of the state.&quot; Stroessner also provided hospitality to a wide array of former Nazi leaders following World War II, including the concentration camp experimenter Dr. Josef Mengele, whom he personally protected despite repeated international demands that he be extradited to Israel. Stroessner routinely imprisoned scores of Paraguayan political opponents, some of whom later insisted that they had endured unethical medical experiments under Mengele's jurisdiction. The strongman also was notorious for his role in <font style="color:#cc0000">Operation Condor</font>, a computerized network of intelligence agencies linking Southern Cone right-wing dictatorships via a U.S.-supplied station, whose purpose was to root out and murder exiled political dissidents who sought refuge in nearby nations.<br>\r\nStroessner's autocratic reign ended in 1989 with a violent golpe instigated by General Andres Rodriguez, and he was forced to seek haven in Brazil. Since then, bringing Stroessner to justice was a slow and ultimately futile process. His mouthpiece, the ruling Partido Colorado, remained hesitant to reveal any details about the late dictator's pathological practices. While in exile, Stroessner was careful not to voice any controversial opinions regarding Latin American issues in order not to embarrass his hosts. He also never traveled outside of Brazil, hoping to avoid the fate of his Chilean counterpart Augusto Pinochet, who was arrested on charges of genocide and terrorism while traveling to London in 1998 on medical grounds. He died in 2006 at the age 93, successfully avoiding justice. Coincidentally, the same day, The Museum of Memory, the Dictatorship and Democracy opens in what had been a clandestine torture center under the Stroessner dictatorshop.\r\n<br>\r\n<i>As dictator, Alfredo Stroessner, received $146 million in US aid, never receiving condemnations for its human rights abuses, the genocide of the indigenous Ache, drug trafficking and open arms policy for ex-Nazis until the 1980s. The only condemnation shortly preceded a 1988 coup. </i></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style="float:right; background-color:black;margin:10px;width:200px;height:720px;position:absolute;top:-10px;right:25px;">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/stroessnercarter.jpg">\r\n<p class="caption" style="font-size:80%;padding:7px;color:#cc0000">\r\nStroessner meeting with\r\nPresident Carter in 1977.</p>\r\n<p style="font-size:80%;padding:7px;color:#cc0000"> Carter said: "We have President Stroessner here with his Foreign Minister and other dignitaries to participate in the signing of a treaty between ourselves and Panama.

Years later, during the rise of liberation theology, CELAM supported the movement and its methodology until a backlash elected a conservative cleric to its leadership in 1972. The election in the Vatican of the right wing Pope John Paul II in 1978 cemented the global swing to the right of the Catholic Church, which distanced itself from its left wing clerics, and led to purges and complicity in the murder of liberation theology proponents during the continent's terror campaigns.</p>	1955	1972	3	30		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:49.57379	2015-02-13 04:07:49.57379	\N
293	A Potential Danger	<p class="entry columns">American Ambassador Robert Woodward reported to Washington in 1955 that the Figueres government is &quot;controversial&quot; and not entirely reliable. True, Figueres had just &quot;expressed appreciation for the activities of the United Fruit Company&quot; and had &quot;dislodged the commies from their powerful position&quot; in the pre-coup government. But he &quot;made himself suspect when he continued to support the Arbenz regime in Guatemala long after it was dominated by communists&quot;; that is, long after this capitalist democracy was targeted for elimination by the CIA.\r\n<br>\r\nAs yet, &quot;the commies have presented no grave problem&quot; in Costa Rica, Ambassador Woodward continued, noting that &quot;the Constitution outlaws the Communist Party.&quot; But the commies represent &quot;a potential danger&quot; because they have not been rooted out of &quot;the laboring class,&quot; and the suspect government &quot;has made no move to stamp out the movement completely,&quot; as a solid commitment to democracy would require. With the &quot;communists&quot; not eliminated entirely, there might be problems in controlling banana workers and other dangerous elements. Who can tell when these subversives might try to organize to struggle for their rights? Thirty years later, the Twentieth Century Fund warns of the problems &quot;brought on by the radicalization of the banana unions under Communist leadership,&quot; including &quot;a lengthy strike in 1984 which resulted in violence—and several deaths.&quot; These and other problems had led the United Fruit Company &quot;to turn some of its acreage over to palm oil—a less labor-intensive crop,&quot; so that such difficulties would not arise.</p>\r\n<p class="captionleft">Pictured in the background, Jose Figueres</p>	1955	1955	1	31	Necessary Illusions Chomsky	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:49.581498	2015-02-13 04:07:49.581498	\N

During their 30 year rule, 60,000 Haitians were killed and countless more were tortured by the Duvaliers' Tonton Macoutes death squads, but in 1969, after 13 years of murderous rule by Papa Doc, U.S.Ambassador Clinton Knox shook hands with the dictator and called for increased aid to Haiti.

338	"Routine" Torture	<table><tr><td td valign=top>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/uruguayusaidform.gif"><p class="captionleft" style="padding:15px;">USAID Project appraisal report (PAR) : project no. 528-11-710-013, Uruguay public safety. \r\n<br>Dated October 1, 1969. Elsewhere in the form, it states: "The Public Safety program is directly related to AID's economic development strategy by creating the stable environment essential to economic growth."</p>\r\n</td><td valign=top>\r\n<p class="entry columns">The US establishes the &quot;Office of Public Safety&quot; in Montevideo. The OPS trained and armed Uruguayan police to combat the Tupumaros/MLM revolutionary forces. Torture expert Dan Mitrione comes to the OPS in 1969 and is credited with making torture &quot;routine&quot; in Uruguay.\r\n<br>\r\nIn Brazil, Mitrione and other Americans worked with OPS, AID and CIA in supplying Brazilian security forces with the equipment and training to facilitate the torture of prisoners. The Americans also advised on how much electric shock could be administered without killing the person, if his or her death might prove awkward.\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the pieces of equipment used was a wire so very thin that it could be fitted into the mouth between the teeth and by pressing against the gum increase the electrical charge. This was a technique that Mitrione had perfected in Brazil. And it was through the diplomatic pouch that Mitrione got some of the equipment he needed for interrogations, including these fine wires. \r\nDan Mitrione had built a soundproofed room in the cellar of his house in Montevideo. In this room he assembled selected Uruguayan police officers to observe a demonstration of torture techniques. Another observer was Manuel Hevia Cosculluela, a Cuban who was with the CIA and worked with Mitrione. Hevia, a double agent, later wrote that the course began with a description of the human anatomy and nervous system ...<br>\r\n<span class="blockquoteitalics">\r\nSoon things turned unpleasant. As subjects for the first testing they took beggars, known in Uruguay as bichicomes, from the outskirts of Montevideo, as well as a woman apparently from the frontier area with Brazil. There was no interrogation, only a demonstration of the effects of different voltages on the different parts of the human body, as well as demonstrating the use of a drug which induces vomiting—I don't know why or what for—and another chemical substance. The four of them died.</span>\r\nTorturing political prisoners in Uruguay had existed before Mitrione's arrival, but things got so bad in Mitrione's time that the Uruguayan Senate was compelled to undertake an investigation. After a five-month study, the commission concluded unanimously that torture in Uruguay had become a "normal, frequent and habitual occurrence", inflicted upon Tupamatos as well as others. Among the types of torture the commission's report made reference to were electric shocks to the genitals, electric needles under the fingernails, burning with cigarettes, the slow compression of the testicles, daily use of psychological torture ... "pregnant women were subjected to various brutalities and inhuman treatment" ... "certain women were imprisoned with their very young infants and subjected to the same treatment" ... \r\n<br>\r\n"The precise pain, in the precise place, in the precise amount, for the desired effect," was Mitrione's motto.\r\n"When you get what you want, and I always get it," he said, "it may be good to prolong the session a little to apply another softening' up. Not to extract information now, but only as a political measure, to create a healthy fear of meddling in subversive activities." \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</td></tr></table>	1965	1969	1	73	 	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:49.678808	2015-02-13 04:07:49.678808	\N

306	Birth of Liberation Theology	<img src="/mapimages/nicamuralnativity.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>\r\n<p class="entry columns">Clerics and theological students across the continent had begun taking a more affirmative position to the Catholic Church's commitment to social issues, influenced by populist governments, socialist movements, the Catholic Workers Movement, and their own experiences. Brazilian clerics began writing treatises in 1959, and during a spirit of openness before and during the Second Vatican Council, critical analysis of the Church's role began to spread across the continent. The Peruvian priest Gustavo Gutierrez was an early leader in these discussions, sharpening the discourse during meetings in Cuba, Mexico and South America. At the Medellin Conference in 1968, priests and others began to coalesce into a movement, and in 1971, Gutierrez coined the term Liberation Theology, just as the church leadership regionally and globally began to turn against them. Cardinal Ratzenberger (later <i>Pope Benedict XVI</i>) issued the Vatican's first official condemnations of Liberation Theology as Marxist in 1984 after meetings with CELAM bishops.</p>	1959	1972	3	66		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:49.704837	2015-02-13 04:07:49.704837	\N

310	"An indigenous-centered Catholicism"	<p class="entry"><img src="/mapimages/ruizchiapas.jpg" class="floatright" style="position:relative;right:0px;top:-30px;">In 1960, Samual Ruiz Garcia is named Bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas. After the Medellin Council of Latin American Bishops in 1968, Ruiz begins to promote liberation theology and an indigenous-centered Catholicism.\r\n</p><p class="entry columns3" style="clear:both;font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;top-padding:-50px;">\r\nBishop Samuel Ruiz often said that, when he was appointed to the diocese in 1959, he found little or nothing had changed in the plight of the indigenous people since the time of Las Casas, nearly 500 years ago. His own life started in poverty: the eldest of 5 children, his parents struggled to survive on a shared smallholding and a little grocery shop in Irapuato, in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato. Schooled irregular at first, in part because of stringent laws against Catholics and their schools in the 1930s post-revolutionary era of persecution of the Mexican Church. At the age of 13, however, things changed when he joined the diocesan minor seminary, even though it was not strictly legal at the time and had no fixed abode. He subsequently had a brilliant early career in the Church, going from the seminary in Mexico to ordination, postgraduate studies and a doctorate in biblical studies in Rome after World War II. On his return to Mexico he became firstly a teacher, then rector of the diocesan seminary in León and subsequently a canon of León Cathedral, before being made Bishop of San Cristobal at the early age of 35.\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived in Chiapas, the state seemed stuck in its past, but the Church in Latin America had begun a process of change, still moving today, although the new bishop was not initially aware of the shape this was taking. The Council of Latin American Bishops (CELAM) met for the first time in Rio de Janeiro in 1955 and the Catholic Church on the sub-continent started to bring together its experiences. Ruiz first followed his predecessor in encouraging the work of catechists, who by their service and the example of their own lives inspired the rest of the community. Later, he criticized this approach for its orientation towards Western attitudes and organization from the top down rather than from among the people themselves using their own cultural values. This comment comes from what is really his own testament to his work, the pastoral letter he wrote to his diocese on the occasion of the visit of Pope John Paul II to the south of Mexico in August 1993, En Esta Hora de Gracia (‘In This Hour of Grace’).\r\n<br>\r\nFrom this and other sources one can sketch what Don Samuel considered to be his own growth in understanding, his ‘conversion’ as he himself called it. He was at the Second Vatican Council and was impressed by the part played by the bishops from Africa in putting together the decree, Ad Gentes about the Church's missionary activity. They were lobbying strongly for a new approach to Christian anthropology, he said on a radio program in his retirement, which would help them more with their missionary work and value the dignity of different cultures. He referred often to the influence that Ad Gentes had on him at a time when he says he himself was still thinking of ways to teach his people to substitute Spanish for their own indigenous languages in order to evangelize them and help them economically. He began to see more clearly that the Spanish missionaries had not come just to evangelize but also to impose their culture. And now here was Ad Gentes, advising Christians to familiarize themselves with their own national and religious traditions and seek out the seeds of The Word that lay latent within these.\r\n<br>\r\nThe ‘conversion’ did not stop there. In 1968, CELAM's second conference in Medellín, Colombia, looked at ways of making Vatican II more readily applicable to the Latin American context. There was a dramatic refocusing towards the widespread misery on the sub-continent, resulting from unjust social and economic structures which the poor were powerless to change. This attention to ‘institutionalised violence’, made a profound impression. So the catechists in Don Samuel’s diocese became the spokespeople of their communities, which were considering all aspects – social, political, economic and cultural – of their situation in order to work out where the Spirit of God was leading them.\r\n<br>\r\nThe next point of departure on Don Samuel’s road was the 1974 Congress of the Indigenous he held in San Cristobal. The communities had elected speakers whom they felt led straight lives and could represent them. The catechists of the diocese now were not just there to help with traditional catechetics, with services and singing, but were genuine representatives of their communities in all the matters most important to them. There followed three days of lament for all the abuses that the indigenous peoples had suffered, with details, but also concrete suggestions about what to do in each case. By then, Don Samuel could speak two of the four languages of the indigenous present with a working knowledge of the others. He learned enough at the meeting to see the inadequacy of his diocesan pastoral plan, which he scrapped there and then and developed another based on what he had heard.\r\n<br>\r\nThe 1979 third conference of CELAM in Puebla, Mexico reinforced Don Samuel’s thinking through its advice to the Church to pursue a path of preferential option for the poor, including the 75 per cent of the people of the diocese of San Cristobal who were indigenous as well as many of those who were not. He quoted the Book of Exodus as a start in trying to help his people follow this directive: ‘I have seen the miserable state of my people in Egypt. I have heard their appeal to be free of their slave drivers. Yes, I am well aware of their sufferings.’ He also had something to say to the rest of us, interpreting St Matthew: ‘Men are blessed when, moved by the Spirit of God, they show solidarity with the poor.’\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the fourth conference of CELAM, at Santo Domingo in 1992 that in many ways satisfied Don Samuel most. In the final document’s reflections on the indigenous peoples, he explain why. ‘The action of God, through his Spirit, is present within all cultures’. ‘One task of evangelization, conducted in terms of the culture, will always be the salvation and comprehensive liberation of a particular people or human group’. Don Samuel’s growing belief and commitment of the previous 30 years now had the unequivocal backing of the Church. The Church had answered the question, at least in theory, once posed to him by one of his people: ‘If the Church does not make itself Tzeltal with the Tzeltal people, or Ch’ol with the Ch’ol people or Tojolobal with the Tojolobales, how can it call itself Catholic?’\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	1960	1960	9	55	Zapatista Timeline by Tom Hansen and Enlace Civil	large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:49.760376	2015-02-13 04:07:49.760376	\N

312	Castro's Shadow	<p class="entry columns">In July 1961, the CIA warned that &quot;the extensive influence of 'Castroism' is not a function of Cuban power. . . . Castro's shadow looms large because social and economic conditions throughout Latin America invite opposition to ruling authority and encourage agitation for radical change,&quot; for which Castro's Cuba provided a model. Earlier, Arthur Schlesinger had transmitted to the incoming President Kennedy his Latin American Mission report, which warned of the susceptibility of Latin Americans to &quot;the Castro idea of taking matters into one's own hands.&quot; The report did identify a Kremlin connection: the Soviet Union &quot;hovers in the wings, flourishing large development loans and presenting itself as the model for achieving modernization in a single generation.&quot; The dangers of the &quot;Castro idea&quot; are particularly grave, Schlesinger later elaborated, when &quot;the distribution of land and other forms of national wealth greatly favors the propertied classes&quot; and &quot;the poor and underprivileged, stimulated by the example of the Cuban revolution, are now demanding opportunities for a decent living.&quot; Kennedy feared that Russian aid might make Cuba a &quot;showcase&quot; for development, giving the Soviets the upper hand throughout Latin America.</p><p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\n&quot;The U.S. government says that a socialist regime here threatens U.S. security.

The one who is threatening the security of the United States is Kennedy, with that aggressive policy. That aggressive policy can give rise to a world war; and that world war can cost the lives of tens of millions of North Americans. Therefore, the one who threatens the security of the United States is not the Cuban Revolutionary Government but the aggressor and aggressive government of the United States.\n<br>\n&quot;We do not endanger the security of a single North American.

308	"We should not hesitate before police repression"	<p class="entry columns" style="position:relative;top:50px;padding:9px; background-color:white;font-size:.95em;">&emsp;A junior officer's coup established a &quot;moderately leftist government [that] lasted for only a few weeks before other officers, responding to pressures from the oligarchy and the United States, staged a countercoup,&quot; a foretaste of what was to come 20 years later. The US Embassy urged support for the military regime, stating that the internal security forces are behind the present government, are strongly anti- Communist, and constitute major force for stability and orderly political and economic development.&quot; Their rule was necessitated by &quot;subversive anti-government activities&quot; such as &quot;underground propaganda,&quot; the Embassy explained, offering an insight into the concept of &quot;subversion&quot; as understood by the Kennedy liberals. Dr. Fabio Castillo, a former president of the National University, testified before Congress that the US had openly participated in the countercoup and had opposed the holding of free elections. The conservative junta was quickly recognized by President Kennedy, whose preference for civil-military regimes was noted earlier*, after they had &quot;pledged to take tough actions against the students [who had protested against the outlawing of political parties, the main proof offered of a Communist plot], cut relations with Castro, and warmly welcomed foreign investment.&quot; The trends of earlier years continued: production, including food production, increased, largely for export, along with starvation and general misery. These trends were enhanced by the Alliance for Progress programs of Kennedy and Johnson. By 1969, 300,000 Salvadorans (one in eight citizens) had fled to Honduras to find food and work. Military aid rapidly increased along with US training and coordination of the military and other security forces of the region.\r\n<br>\r\n<span class="caption"><i>Pictured</i>, Julio Carballo, center, leader of the counter-coup.</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="position:relative;top:30px;font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n*There is no point\r\nwasting time in patiently explaining to our leaders that the policies they\r\npursue are inconsistent with the goals they profess; they know this well\r\nenough without our help. Nor is there any reason to suppose that a\r\ndifferent group of leaders would react in any essentially different way to\r\nthe same institutional imperatives. It is not failure to understand a\r\nsimple point so clear to us that regularly leads the political leadership to\r\ncommit the same “error” over and over again.\r\n<br>&emsp;Returning to [George] Kennan’s prescriptions, what means must we use\r\nagainst our enemies who fall prey to the heresy that threatens our\r\nresources? Kennan explains, in the same briefing to the Ambassadors:\r\n<span class="blockquote">\r\nThe final answer might be an unpleasant one, but . . . we should\r\nnot hesitate before police repression by the local government. This\r\nis not shameful since the Communists are essentially traitors . . .\r\nIt is better to have a strong regime in power than a liberal\r\ngovernment if it is indulgent and relaxed and penetrated by\r\nCommunists.</span>\r\n\r\n&emsp;Again, as policy becomes practice, the term “Communists” takes on\r\nits technical sense in American political discourse, referring to people\r\nwho do not appreciate the sanctity of the Fifth Freedom.\r\n<br>&emsp;It is small wonder, then, that John F. Kennedy should have held that\r\n“governments of the civil-military type of El Salvador are the most\r\neffective in containing Communist penetration in Latin America.” This\r\nwas after a military coup overthrew a liberal civilian government, with\r\nUS approval, while the Kennedy Administration was organizing the basic\r\nstructure of the military and paramilitary “death squads” that have\r\nmassacred tens of thousands of civilians since, within the framework of\r\nthe Alliance for Progress—in fact, the most lasting effect of that program apart from its contributions to dependent development in the US\r\ninterest.</p>	1960	1969	1	78	Turning the Tide by Noam Chomsky	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:49.845547	2015-02-13 04:07:49.845547	\N
676	Guatemalan workers win a five year union struggle against Coca-Cola	<div class="page" data-title="The Situation"></div>\r\n<p class="entry" style="width:550px;float:left;padding-right:9px;">\r\n<span class="intro" style="color: black;">\r\n&emsp;In Guatemala workers win a five year union struggle against Coca-Cola.</span>\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n\r\nThe Coke franchise in Guatemala City had passed from\r\nUnited Fruit in the 1950s, and was now run by Texas businessman John Trotter.\r\nA lawyer who loved polyester suits and hated communism, Trotter flew in on his\r\nPiper Club plane every few weeks to give pep talks to local managers. Mostly he\r\nharped on one theme–the evil of unions, which he ranked second only to\r\ncommunists in their desire to snatch away the god-given profits of the working\r\nbusinessman. Under no circumstances, he told them, should the cancer of\r\nunionism be allowed to affect the plant.\r\n<br>&emsp;<img src="/mapimages/cokebottle.png" class="floatright" style="transform: rotate(175deg);">\r\nWorkers at the Coke plant at the time suffered under inhuman working\r\nconditions, spending twelve-hour shifts loading crates at the minimum wage of\r\n$2 a day. By spring of 1976, more than 80 percent of the two hundred-some\r\nworkers signed papers to unionize in an effort to improve their lot. When union\r\nleaders Israel Márquez and Pedro Quevedo presented the petition to Trotter,\r\nhowever, the Texan refused to recognize it, firing 154 workers. With the law on\r\ntheir side, the workers successfully sued for reinstatement–but Trotter and local\r\nexecutives continued to break up the union, subdividing the bottler into other\r\ncompanies to make it more difficult for workers to organize. The Coke workers\r\nreached out to the Catholic Church for help, and were answered by a\r\nPhiladelphia-based order of nuns called the Sisters of Providence, who owned\r\ntwo hundred shares of Coca-Cola stock–as a way to generate wealth for their\r\norder and to influence policy abroad.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n\r\nHorrified to hear of the situation, its leader, Sister Dorothy Garland, contacted\r\nthe Coca-Cola Company to demand changes. Coke's president, Luke Smith,\r\nadmitted tension, but said the franchise agreement tied the company's hands.\r\n"There is no provision in the bottlers' agreement . . . which give us any right to\r\nintervene on such a dispute," he explained. Undeterred, the nuns filed a\r\nshareholders' resolution at the company's annual meeting in 1977 to demand an\r\nindependent investigation into the issue.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style="float:right;border-style: double;padding:9px;\r\nborder-color: #cc0000;\r\nborder: 6px double #cc0000;\r\noutline: 3px solid #cc0000;\r\noutline-offset: -1px;\r\nwidth:425px;\r\nbackground-color:white;\r\nfont-family: arial, helvetica;\r\nfont-size: .9em;">\r\n<span class="medhed" style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Coca-Cola Killings</span>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class="date">1979</span><br>\r\n<strong>5 April</strong> Manuel Lapez Balam, general secretary of STEGAC (Trade Union of Workers in the Guatemala Bottling and Associated Companies), is killed by a group armed with knives and iron bars as he is delivering crates of Coca-Cola.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>18 June</strong> Silverio Vâsquez, an EGSA worker, is shot and wounded by a plant security guard.

Fredy Maldonado, the production manager, besides having a degree in business was also an army officer. There was a captain there, as well as a lieutenant who was in charge of personnel, Lieutenant Francisco Javier Rodas. They were army officers, regulars in the army. Therefore, it was very delicate working in the plant. Many people quit despite wages that were a bit higher than those paid in other workplaces. They couldn't find security or stability within the company.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nI began to become more and more involved in the union but always as a rank-and-file member and not a leader. We began to form support groups for the executive committee of the union. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn 1980, problems intensified, not only in the Coca-Cola factory but also throughout the entire country. Even though a collective bargaining pact was in place, it wasn't enforced. The staff was subjected to inhumane treatment. For instance, our official workday began in the sales department at seven o'clock in the morning, but we had to arrive by six o'clock to wash the truck and prepare for the day. However, the clock didn't begin to count our working time until seven o'clock. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThere was much pressure on the staff, but there was also a great crisis at the national level. Later on, right after the assassination of compañero Manuel López in April of 1980, my compañero Marlon also was assassinated. Marlon had joined Coca-Cola with my group, and he, too, became involved in the union after his hiring. Marlon was very conscious of his role as a worker, and, in spite of the fact that the company had hired him to cause problems, he joined the union almost immediately. He was assassinated in April of 1980. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThis assassination polarized the situation even more. After they killed the compañero Marlon, the personnel manager Lieutenant Francisco Javier Rodas was killed. He was a very aggressive person. Later, during the May Day demonstration, many people were kidnapped. A lot. The exact number was never known. At least two Coca-Cola workers were kidnapped, and their bodies appeared, cruelly tortured and mutilated. And many more compañeros from other unions were disappeared. A direct confrontation broke out when the revolutionary organizations responded...\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAt about eleven o'clock in the morning on June 21st, the CNT was\r\nbroken into and all the people attending the meeting were taken\r\naway. Included in this group were two compañeros from the Coca-Cola\r\nunion. Later, these leaders were referred to as the "detained-disappeared."\r\nThis was a kidnapping, but it began with a detention,\r\nwith an office broken into, and a door broken down by a police car.\r\nWhen a request Is made that someone be presented to the court,\r\na writ of habeus corpus must be used. We did this, and the court\r\nsaid, "We don't have access to them; it's a police matter." So we\r\nmembers of the Coca-Cola union decided to go on strike until the\r\ncompañeros reappeared or were released. The company asked for\r\npolice intervention; however, we were able to maintain a strike for\r\nmany days. One day, two compañeros were Injured when several\r\nmen drove by in cars and on motorcycles shooting with machine\r\nguns into the factory. This did not intimidate us; we continued to\r\nput on the pressure.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nMy participation at that time was as a rank-and-fiIe member. We\r\ncarried out what the executive committee determined had to be\r\ndone. The executive committee ordered us to block the entrances\r\nwith trucks, to block them as much as possible with bottles.' We\r\nhad occupied the plant.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe police came, and two more compañeros were captured. The\r\npolice confronted us and said whoever didn't want to work could\r\nleave the factory. They ordered that the strike be ended. There were\r\nabout two hundred heavily armed police with weapons aimed at\r\nus. It is tough to disobey an order when there are machine guns\r\naimed at you. So factory operations were restarted, but the\r\ncompañeros for whom that strike was carried out never reappeared."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<span class="entry_source">The Sky Never Changes: Testimonies from the Guatemalan Labor Movement  By Thomas F. Reed</span>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="The End of Trotter"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="padding: 20px;">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&emsp;\r\nBefore the vote on the nuns' shareholders' resolution, Coke announced its own investigation, which came back a few months later, exonerating Trotter. The nuns cried foul, even as a new\r\npresident assumed power in Guatemala in 1978. General Romeo Lucas Garcia\r\nwas one in a long line of military leaders who had ruled the country since a \r\n<a data-entry="290" data-year="1954" class="inline" style="color:black;font-weight:bold;">CIA-sponsored coup in the 1950s.</a> But the avowed anticommunist was particularly\r\nbrutal in his crackdown on "subversive elements," directing his secret police to\r\nrout any leftist influences in government, academia, and industry–including unions.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of the situation, Trotter threatened the union organizers\r\nwith violence if they didn't give up their efforts. Shortly thereafter, Israel\r\nMárquez was sprayed by machine-gun fire in his jeep, narrowly escaping with\r\nhis life. Pedro Quevedo wasn't so lucky. Sitting in his truck during deliveries, he\r\nwas ambushed by two men, who pumped four rounds into his face, then another\r\neight into his throat before driving away on waiting motorcycles. Another union\r\nleader, Manuel Lopez Balan, was also killed, his throat slit while making\r\ndeliveries on his route.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nEven as most of the workers resigned from the union, Marquez traveled to\r\nWilmington to confront Coke chairman Paul Austin at the 1978 annual meeting.\r\nIn a soft voice, he detailed the murders of his colleagues, before directly\r\nappealing to Austin's business sense. <span style="font-family: helvetica;\r\nfont-weight: bold; font-size: .9em;">"Coca-Cola's image in Guatemala could\r\nnot be worse," said the small Guatemalan man through a translator. "[In\r\nGuatemala,] murder is called 'Coca-Cola.'</span> I have come here today to ask your\r\nimmediate help so that blood no longer flows through the Coca-Cola plant."\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn truth, Austin's hands were tied–intervene in the dispute and he'd call the\r\nentire franchise system into question, potentially opening the Coca-Cola\r\nCompany up to a flood of labor complaints from other countries. At the same\r\ntime, if he didn't intervene, he'd abrogate all the goodwill he'd so eagerly sought\r\nthrough Coke's "Corporate Social Responsibility" efforts. Even as Coke execs privately decided not to renew\r\n\r\nTrotter's contract, they declined to break it, instead sending another company\r\nexec to investigate the situation. He, too, exonerated the franchisee–and no\r\nwonder, since he never even questioned Trotter or set foot inside the plant.\r\nUnconvinced, the Guatemalans appealed to the International Union of Food and\r\nAllied Workers (lUF), a Geneva-based super-union, which issued a call to\r\nboycott Coke in November 1979 and instigated work stoppages al Coke plants in\r\nFinland, Sweden, and New Zealand.\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/cokebottle.png" class="floatright" style="transform: rotate(185deg);">\r\n&emsp;\r\nAs the situation quickly grew out of hand, the company assured critics that it\r\nwould not be renewing Trotter's contract when it expired in 1981. Meanwhile,\r\nthe rampage continued, with four more union organizers killed. Street protests\r\nagainst Coke in Guatemala led to a dramatic fall in the company's market share.\r\nFinally, the pressure was too much for Coke to stall any longer. Even though it\r\nhad repeatedly claimed it could do nothing until the contract expired, company\r\nexecs flew to Houston in July 1980 to present Trotter with an offer he couldn't\r\nrefuse–a generous buyout by two handpicked bottling executives, with most of\r\nthe financing provided by Coke Atlanta, and no questions asked. The new\r\nowners approved a contract with the union after the sale.\r\nBut Coke's stalling had left eight workers dead–a legacy in Guatemala that\r\nwould come to haunt the company again in more recent years.\r\n</p>	1980	1980	7	44	The Coke Machine By Michael Blanding	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:49.860241	2015-02-13 04:07:49.860241	\N

592	The Beginning of Jose Figueres	<p class="entry columns3">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/josefigueres.jpg" style="width:100%;"><br>\r\nAn anti-communist revolution led by Jose Figueres, <i>pictured</i>, and supported by United States is successful in Costa Rica. Figueres, three-time president of Costa Rica, later admits to his connections with CIA. If ever the CIA maintained a love-hate relationship, it was with Jose Figueres, three times the head of state of Costa Rica. \r\n<br> On the one hand, Figueres, by his own admission in 1975, worked for the CIA "in 20,000 ways … all over Latin America" for 30 years. "I collaborated with the CIA when we were trying to topple Trujillo," he divulged, speaking of the Dominican Republic dictator.\r\n<br> On the other hand, Figueres revealed that the Agency had twice tried to kill him. He did not elaborate, although he stated at the same time that he had tried for two years to get the Bay of Pigs invasion called off. This may have precipitated one or both of the assassination attempts. \r\n<br> The CIA also tried to overthrow the Figueres government. In 1964, the first significant expose of the Agency, <i>The Invisible Government</i>, disclosed that: \r\n<span class="blockquote" style="font-style:italic;">in the mid-1950s CIA agents intruded deeply into the political affairs of Costa Rica, the most stable and democratic republic in Latin America. Knowledgeable Costa Ricans were aware of the CIA's role. The CIA's purpose was to promote the ouster of Jose (Pepe) Figueres, the moderate socialist who became President in a fair and open election in 1953.</span>\r\n<br> Figueres remained in office until 1958, in his first term as president; he had headed a liberal junta in the late 1940s. \r\n<br> The Agency's "major grievance was that Figueres had scrupulously recognized the right of asylum in Costa Rica&mdash;for non-Communists and Communists alike. The large influx of questionable characters complicated the agency's job of surveillance and forced it to increase its staff."\r\n<br>\r\nThe CIA's problems with Figueres actually went somewhat deeper. Costa Rica was a haven for hundreds of exiles fleeing from various Latin American right-wing dictatorships, such as in the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, and Figueres was providing groups of them with material and moral support in their plans to overthrow these regimes. To Figueres, this was entirely in keeping with his antitotalitarian beliefs, directed against the left as well as the right. The problem was that the dictators targeted for overthrow were all members in good standing of the United States' anti-Communist, "Free-World" club (The American attitude toward Trujillo was later modified). Moreover, Figueres had on occasion expressed criticism of the American policy of supporting such dictatorships while neglecting the economic and social problems of the hemisphere.\r\n<br>\r\nThese considerations could easily outweigh the fact that Figueres had established his anti-Communist credentials, albeit not of the "ultra" variety, and was no more a "socialist" than US Senator Hubert Humphrey. Although Figueres spoke out strongly at times against foreign investment, as president he was eminently accommodating to Central America's <i>bêtes noires</i>, the multinational fruit companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	1948	1948	1	86	Killing Hope by William Blum	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:50.56948	2015-02-13 04:07:50.56948	\N

Robert Kennedy was dispatched to Brazil in December 1962 to influence Goulart to &quot;confront the communist problem,&quot; as the US Embassy put it. RFK informed Goulart that the President was seriously concerned about the infiltration of &quot;Communists and anti-American nationalist leftists&quot; into the government, the military, the unions, and student groups, and about the &quot;ill treatment [of] American and other foreign private investors.&quot; If Goulart wanted US aid, Kennedy said, he must see to it that &quot;personnel in key Brazilian positions&quot; were pro-American, and impose economic measures that the US recommended.\n\nRelations remained tense, particularly over the austerity plan that the Kennedy Administration demanded as a condition for aid, and its admonitions about left-wing influence. </p>	1962	1962	1	15	Year 501	medium	f	2015-02-13 04:07:49.899713	2015-02-13 04:07:49.899713	\N

322	Mongoose and Nuclear Armegeddon	<p class="entry columns">Operation Mongoose was &quot;the centerpiece of American policy toward Cuba from late 1961 until the onset of the 1962 missile crisis,&quot; Mark White reports, the program on which the Kennedy brothers &quot;came to pin their hopes.&quot; Robert Kennedy informed the CIA that the Cuban problem carries &quot;the top priority in the United States Government—all else is secondary—no time, no effort, or manpower is to be spared&quot; in the effort to overthrow the Castro regime. The chief of Mongoose operations, Edward Lansdale, provided a timetable leading to &quot;open revolt and overthrow of the Communist regime&quot; in October 1962. The &quot;final definition&quot; of the program recognized that &quot;final success will require decisive U.S. military intervention,&quot; after terrorism and subversion had laid the basis. The implication is that US military intervention would take place in October 1962—when the missile crisis erupted.\r\n<br>\r\nIn February 1962, the Joint Chiefs of Staff approved a plan more extreme than Schlesinger's: to use &quot;covert means . . . to lure or provoke Castro, or an uncontrollable subordinate, into an overt hostile reaction against the United States; a reaction which would in turn create the justification for the US to not only retaliate but destroy Castro with speed, force and determination.&quot; In March, at the request of the DOD Cuba Project, the Joint Chiefs of Staff submitted a memorandum to Defense Secretary Robert McNamara outlining &quot;pretexts which they would consider would provide justification for US military intervention in Cuba.&quot; The plan would be undertaken if &quot;a credible internal revolt is impossible of attainment during the next 9-10 months,&quot; but before Cuba could establish relations with Russia that might &quot;directly involve the Soviet Union.&quot;\r\n<br>\r\nOn August 23 the president issued National Security Memorandum No. 181, &quot;a directive to engineer an internal revolt that would be followed by U.S. military intervention,&quot; involving &quot;significant U.S. military plans, maneuvers, and movement of forces and equipment&quot; that were surely known to Cuba and Russia. Also in August, terrorist attacks were intensified, including speedboat strafing attacks on a Cuban seaside hotel &quot;where Soviet military technicians were known to congregate, killing a score of Russians and Cubans&quot;; attacks on British and Cuban cargo ships; the contamination of sugar shipments; and other atrocities and sabotage, mostly carried out by Cuban exile organizations permitted to operate freely in Florida. A few weeks later came &quot;the most dangerous moment in human history.&quot;\r\n<br>\r\n<font class="bigquote">&quot;A bad press in some friendly countries&quot;</font><br>\r\nTerrorist operations continued through the tensest moments of the missile crisis. They were formally canceled on October 30, several days after the Kennedy and Khrushchev agreement, but went on nonetheless. On November 8, &quot;a Cuban covert action sabotage team dispatched from the United States successfully blew up a Cuban industrial facility,&quot; <font style="color:#cc0000">killing 400 workers</font>, according to the Cuban government. Raymond Garthoff writes that &quot;the Soviets could only see [the attack] as an effort to backpedal on what was, for them, the key question remaining: American assurances not to attack Cuba.&quot; These and other actions reveal again, he concludes, &quot;that the risk and danger to both sides could have been extreme, and catastrophe not excluded.&quot;</p>	1962	1962	1	32	Hegemony or Survival Chomsky	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:49.91857	2015-02-13 04:07:49.91857	\N

His inaugural call that America\r\nwas ready to &quot;pay any price, bear any burden&quot; revived a muscular internationalism\r\nthat had atrophied. In addition to bringing in Robert\r\nMcNamara\r\n<img src="/mapimages/generalmaxwelltaylor.jpg" class="floatright"> from the Ford Motor Company to rationalize the Department\r\nof Defense, Kennedy and his civilian advisers looked to\r\ncounterinsurgency and covert operations as a way of both breaking\r\nthe nuclear deadlock and controlling the rise of third-world nationalism. Kennedy ordered the military to create a branch of the Special Forces that could operate with more flexibility in the third world and\r\nset up a &quot;Special Group&quot; in the White House, headed by General\r\nMaxwell Taylor, <i>pictured (from his TIme Magazine Cover)</i>, to coordinate special-warfare policy at the highest\r\nechelons of government—with the result that superpower conflict\r\nwas detoured outside of Europe, particularly into Southeast Asia .\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn Latin America, Kennedy's vaulting idealism led to the Alliance\r\nfor Progress, an ambitious project that wedded the revolutionary\r\nand counterrevolutionary traditions of American diplomacy—as\r\ndid Theodore Roosevelt and other missionary presidents of an earlier\r\nera—this time to especially toxic effect. Announcing the program\r\nto a room full of Latin American ambassadors soon after his\r\ninauguration, Kennedy sought to steal Castro's insurgent thunder,\r\ncommitting Washington to &quot;completing the revolution of the\r\nAmericas.&quot; He promised billions of dollars in development aid in exchange\r\nfor enacting land, tax, judicial, and electoral reform aimed at\r\nbreaking up extreme concentrations of economic and political\r\npower, &quot;to build,&quot; as the president put it, &quot;a hemisphere where all\r\nmen can hope for a suitable standard of living and all can live out\r\ntheir lives in dignity and in freedom.&quot;\r\n<span style="float:right">\r\n<iframe width="350" height="262" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7Co6rjlprsg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>\r\n&quot;Let us once again transform\r\nthe American Continent into a vast crucible of revolutionary ideas\r\nand efforts,&quot; Kennedy roared, &quot;a tribute to the power of the creative\r\nenergies of free men and women, an example to all the world\r\nthat liberty and progress walk hand in hand. Let us once again\r\nawaken our American revolution until it guides the struggles of people\r\neverywhere—not with an imperialism of force or fear but the\r\nrule of courage and freedom and hope for the future of man.&quot;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="The Intelligence Agencies"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns"  style="background-color:white;padding:2px;">\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/kennedyallendulles1961.jpg" class="floatright"><br>\r\n<span class="caption">John F.

His administration committed the United States\r\nto strengthening the internal security capabilities of Latin American\r\nnations to protect against subversion, turning the region into\r\na counterinsurgent laboratory. Advisers from the State and Defense\r\nDepartments and the CIA worked to reinforce local intelligence\r\noperations, schooling security forces in interrogation and\r\nguerrilla warfare techniques, providing technology and equipment,\r\nand, when necessary, conducting preemptive coups. It was\r\nduring this period that national intelligence agencies fortified\r\nand, in some cases, created by the United States—Argentina's Secretaria\r\nde Inteligencia del Estaclo, Chile's Direccion Nacional de\r\nInteligencia, Brazil's Sistema Nacional de lnformacoes, El Salvador's\r\nAgencia Nacional de Servicios Especiales—began to transform themselves\r\ninto the command centers of the region's death-squad\r\nsystem, which throughout the 1970s and 1980s executed hundreds\r\nof thousands of Latin Americans and tortured tens of thousands\r\nmore. Millions were driven into exile. Throughout the worst of the repression,\r\nWashington nominally continued to support Latin America's\r\n&quot;democratic left.&quot; But the most passionate defenders of\r\nliberalization and democracy were likely to be found in the ranks of\r\nWashington's opponents—and singled out for execution by Washington's\r\nallies.\r\n<img src="/mapimages/kennedyoasafp1961.jpg" style="padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;"><br>\r\n<span class="caption">President Kennedy with OAS task force in 1961 to discuss Alliance for Progress</span>\r\n\r\n</p>	1961	1961	1	74	Empire's Workshop, Greg Grandin	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:49.926384	2015-02-13 04:07:49.926384	\N

Their myths relate how\r\ntheir first ruler, Manco Capac, brought the tribe to that valley either from\r\nthe shores of Lake Titicaca or, in another version, from the 'windows' or\r\ncaves at Paccari-Tambo, a place some eighteen miles south-east of Cuzco.\r\nLike Quetzalcoatl for the Toltecs and Aztecs, the mythical figure of Manco\r\nCapac was revered as the bringer of civilization to the world; he was also\r\nworshipped for being a direct descendant of the Sun God, a family connection\r\nwhich gave Inca rulers a quasi-divine status.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn the late fourteenth century the Incas subjugated the other tribes in\r\nthe Cuzco valley, and their imperial career began in earnest in 1438, when the\r\ngreat conqueror, Yupanqui Inca Pachacuti, 'the Transformer', ascended the\r\nthrone. Between 1438 and 1463 he extended Inca rule to the region of Lake\r\nTiticaca, and thence north-west. Other conquests by both Pachacuti and his\r\nson Topa Inca brought northern territories as far as Quito under Inca control.\r\nPachacuti who laid the foundations of the well-organized Inca state\r\ncentred upon Cuzco, a holy city which possessed the imposing Temple of\r\nthe Sun representing the very source of Inca power.  In 1471 Pachacuti was\r\nsucceeded by Topa Inca, who, having already subdued the great Chimu\r\nkingdom in the north, ventured south into present-day Chile, establishing\r\nthe limit of Inca power at the River Maule in the territory of the Araucanian\r\nIndians. From 1493 the next supreme Inca. Huayna Capac, became \r\n</td>\r\n\r\n<td width="66%">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/incaruins.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\n\r\ninvolved\r\nin an extended campaign against rebellious ethnic kingdoms on the northern\r\nfrontier \r\nzones, especially around Quito. \r\nUpon Huayna Capac's death some time between 1525 and 1528, his natural son Atahuallpa seized these frontier\r\nterritories with the help of several important generals and launched a coup\r\nd'etat against the legitimate successor, his half-brother Huascar. It was during\r\nthe ensuing civil war that Francisco Pizarro happened to arrive in the\r\nkingdoms of the Sun.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn less than a hundred years the Incas had built the most formidable empire\r\nin the Western Hemisphere. Like that of the Aztecs, their dominion was\r\ncharacterized essentially by the levying of tribute from scores of subject\r\nkingdoms and tribes. But the Incas went much further than the Aztecs in\r\ndeveloping a centralized bureaucratic state at the service of a supreme ruling\r\nclass. In this the physical peculiarities of the Andean region were directly\r\ninfluential.\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Agriculture"></div>\r\n\r\n<div class="entry" style="background-color: #FAFAFA; background-image: url(/mapimages/incaagriculture.jpg);height: 710px;\r\nwidth: 1020px; position: relative; left: -10px; top: -53px;">\r\n\r\n<p style="width: 602px; background-color: #FAFAFA; padding:9px;position: relative; top: 31px;">\r\n&emsp;\r\nThe geography of the area covered by the Inca empire is marked by great\r\ncontrasts of climate and terrain. Ascending from the rainless deserts of the\r\ncoast to the snow-capped peaks of the Andes, one passes through sharply\r\nvarying ecological environments. On the coast, agriculture is possible only\r\nin the vicinity of rivers or on land under irrigation; fishing has therefore\r\nalways been important. In the highlands, altitude determines the kind of\r\ncrops that can be produced; for instance, maize will grow well up to 11,000\r\nfeet while at higher levels tubers and grams can be cultivated. In the cold,\r\nwindswept puna - steppe-like grasslands just below the snow-line - no\r\nagriculture is possible, though pasture is available for the llamas, vicunas and\r\nother ruminants that provide meat and wool. Each level forms an 'ecological\r\ntier' yielding a particular range of produce, and yet there is not enough fertile\r\nland on any one tier to sustain a large population.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOver the centuries Andean societies developed a way of overcoming this\r\nproblem by sending out settlers to cultivate crops at different altitudes in\r\norder to complement the produce of their native territories. Andean societies\r\nwere not therefore territorially integrated units, but took rather the form of\r\n"vertical archipelagos" comprising the ancestral homeland - which provided\r\nthe core of tribal identity - and outlying agrarian settlements on a number\r\nof ecological tiers specializing in various types of produce for distribution\r\nand exchange among the dispersed branches of the tribe. Geography thus\r\nproduced a unique economic structure, which, in turn, determined social\r\nvalues and practices. Where fertile land, being scarce, needed to be so carefully\r\nhusbanded, it is little wonder that its distribution had to be closely regulated\r\nby the community and that a spirit of co-operation should be so highly\r\nprized among members of the tribe. As a result, the two ruling principles of\r\nAndean tribal society were redistribution and reciprocity.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Structure"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\n&emsp;The basic social unit was the <strong>Ayllu</strong>, an extended kinship group or clan\r\nsimilar to the calpulli in Middle America. Each ayllu possessed land which it\r\nallocated to heads of families, who could cultivate it for themselves but were\r\nnot allowed to sell it to others. It was common practice within the ayllu for\r\nan individual member to work a neighbour's fields in return for similar\r\nassistance; he would also render tribute by taking turn to labour for a time\r\nin the fields of the ayllu headman and the tribal chieftains. Given the intrinsic\r\ndifficulties of the terrain, the ayllus had to join together to perform certain\r\ncollective tasks, such as the building of terraces to enlarge the area of\r\ncultivation and the construction of systems of irrigation. Because of the threat\r\nof crop failure in such a fickle climate, a number of public warehouses were\r\nused to store grain and other crops for distribution in case of famine. The\r\nproduce from the different ecological tiers had to be distributed to all the\r\nayllus in the tribe. Thus the geography of the Andes dictated a high degree\r\nof collective action and central regulation within the tribal communities.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe Incas elaborated upon these traditional practices of communal regulation and reciprocal services in order to build an imperial state. Inca imperialism did not eliminate local identities; rather, it added a higher stratum of\r\nauthority to the pre-existing tribal hierarchies. Traditional ethnic chieftains,\r\nunder the supervision of Inca governors and Inca garrisons, were responsible\r\nfor the collection of tribute from their people for the Inca aristocracy. Tribute\r\nwas received from subject peoples largely in the form of labour. The local\r\ntraditions of collective work were taken over by the imperial state and\r\ntransformed into the mita, a system of forced labour by which the colonized\r\nSupreme Being, Viracocha, creator of the universe, from\r\nwere ultimately derived. The doctrine of Viracocha's pre-eminence,\r\nhowever, did not displace the cult of the Sun God. Inca cosmogony, like \r\nthat of the Aztecs and the Mayas, divided the history of the universe into\r\n'suns', each age having been brought to an end by a cataclysm. The Fifth\r\nSun had been inaugurated by the Inca Manco Capac, and it was his descendants who were charged with ensuring the continuing survival of the world through sacrifice and expiation. Although not as prodigal of human life as\r\nthe Aztecs, the Incas sacrificed youths, girls and children - all of whom had\r\nto be physically perfect - on occasions when the usual sacrifice of llamas was\r\ndeemed insufficient to save the world from calamity.\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="testorama"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\nThe religious establishment was large and influential. A hierarchy of\r\npriests, headed by immediate relatives of the Inca himself, served the many\r\ntemples and huacas found throughout the empire: at the Temple of the Sun\r\nin Cuzco some 4,000 people were engaged in the ministry of the state\r\nreligion. Religious communities of 'chosen women', who were recruited as\r\nyoung girls from all parts of the empire, performed a variety of duties: some\r\nmight be selected for sacrifice to the gods, others as concubines for the Inca\r\nand his favorites; the rest would be employed in weaving precious vicuna\r\nwool into garments for the royal family, or in preparing food and libations\r\nfor the frequent ceremonies that were held by priests and nobles.\r\nThis very close identification of religion with government afforded enormous power to the Inca state. In the remains of great buildings in Cuzco, in the massive fortress of Sacsahuaman or in the ruined city of Macchu Picchu,\r\nall constructed with huge boulders cut to shape and fitted exactly into place,\r\nthere survive impressive monuments to its extraordinary capacity to mobilize\r\nhuman labour. Perhaps extreme regimentation by the state was necessary to\r\ncompensate for technical deficiencies in an otherwise sophisticate civilization: without beasts of burden or knowledge of the wheel, the Incas depended crucially on manpower. But their true success lay in the skill with which they built up a polity that transcended by far the limits of the tribe.\r\nThe business of government was turned into a dynastic monopoly based on privileged knowledge, not just as regards the arcana of religion but also at a\r\nmore mundane level: the absence of a system of writing restricted important information to a closed oligarchy, who had access to records kept on knotted cords known as quipus. Such privileged knowledge increased the possibilities\r\nof political control over the passive multitude of commoners whose cultures remained entirely oral. So long as belief in the divine origin of the Inca dynasty and in its right to extensive privileges could be upheld, the edifice\r\nof state would remain in place. In 1531, however, Francisco Pizarro\r\nand his company of infidels found their way into the Inca empire, Tahuantin-suyu,\r\ncausing that great pyramid of state to collapse when they violated the sacred\r\npinnacle of its authority.\r\n<br>\r\nIn the Lima museum, there are hundreds of skulls which have undergone trepanning and the insertion of gold and silver plates by Inca surgeons. </p>	1491	1491	2	65	The Penguin History of Latin America, Edwin Williamson	large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:49.937158	2015-02-13 04:07:49.937158	\N

331	The First Dictator of the Dictatorship	\r\n<div>\r\n<p class="entry" style="float:left;width:230px;">In 1961, Time magazine called Brazil's domestic politics "confused" and said the country was "also adrift in foreign affairs". What Time seemed to mean was that Brazilian President Jaao Goulart's policies were unacceptable to the U.S. Goulart sought to trade with communist nations, supported the labor movement, and had limited the profits muftinationals could take out of the country. Although high ranking U.S. intelligence personnel such as Defense Attache (and later Deputy Director of the CIA) Vernon Walters, deny the U.S. took part in the 1964 overthrow of Goulart by General Humberto de Alencar Castello Branco, there is evidence to the contrary. For example, right before the coup, U.S. officials cabled Washington a request for oil for Branco's soldiers in case Goulart's troops blew up the refineries.\r\n<br>\r\nBranco's regime was short but brutal.

341	John Longan In Guatemala	<div class="page" data-title="The Overt...."></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="columns" style="padding:9px;background:white;">\r\n&emsp;In December 1965, US security advisor John Longan arrived in Guatemala City to restore stability. Hoping to professionalize Guatemala's intelligence system, Longan and other American advisors centralized the operations of the police and military, training them to gather, analyze and act on intelligence in a coordinated and rapid manner. Longan identified a need for "fundamental elementary work in organization, coordination, and basic police activity." \r\n<br>&emsp;On December 5, he held the first in a series of workshops with the heads of the Judicial and National Police, military officers, including Colonel Rafael Arriaga Bosque, and two other US public safety advisors. Longan laid out plans for combined "overt" and "covert" operations collectively called "Operacion Limpieza" - Operation Cleanup. In the overt phase of the operation, the "Army, the Judicial Police, and the National Police" would carry out sweeps in "suspect areas in hope that some criminal or subversive elements could be caught in net and lead to further openings." Longan instructed the officers in a maneuver dubbed the "frozen area plan," which entailed the cordoning off a four block radius, establishing an outer perimeter, and searching the secured area for subversives and information. On the covert side, Longan recommended the creation of a small "action unit to mastermind campaign against terrorists which would have access to all information from law enforcement agencies. . . ." A team of "trusted investigators" would work from a "special room to be called 'The Box,'" a 24-hour nerve center equipped with telecommunications and electronic surveillance equipment staffed by military colonels and captains and located at Matamoros, the military's general headquarters in downtown Guatemala City. Responsibility for the full operation, including command of "The Box," was given to Arriaga Bosque, the commanding officer of Matamoros. The overt and covert sides of the proposed operation complemented each other. Intelligence picked up from wide sweeps using the frozen area plan was to be sent to 'The Box' to be analyzed and deployed in more focused clandestine raids, which in turn would provide information for larger dragnets.\r\n<br>&emsp;Equipped with state of the art telecommunications and surveillance equipment and operating out of military headquarters, Arriaga began to carry out widespread raids. By the end of February, eighty operations&#8212;and a number of extrajudicial executions&#8212;had taken place. Then between March 3 and March 5, Operacion Limpieza netted its largest catch. On March 2, the military and police picked up three guerrilla leaders. On the third, the police captured Leonardo Leonardo Castillo Flores, who headed the national peasant union under Arbenz, and three other PGT-FAR members on the south coast. The next day, the fourth, special security officers from Guatemala City arrived to interrogate the prisoners, which according to a CIA document apparently yielded information on Guatemala City safe houses. The following day, the police and military detained a number of PGT leaders, including Victor Manuel Gutierrez - the head of the national labor union under Arbenz. By March 5, security forces had captured scores of members of the PGT, FAR, and MR-13 (a Trotskist split from the FAR) in coordinated operations throughout the country, including the capital and the southern coast. The oft stated US goal of effective use of intelligence and coordinated operations between police and military and between the countryside and the city was now a reality.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="...The Covert"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="columns" style="padding:9px;background:white;">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/victormanuelgutierrez.jpg" class="floatright">&emsp;Judicial Police took Gutierrez to their downtown headquarters, where they submitted him to a torture dubbed la capucha. They covered his head with cowl and shocked him with electric currents, which according to one witness quickly proved too much for Gutierrez, who suffered from a frail heart. Security forces transferred most of the rest of those captured in Guatemala City to the Matamoros military base, where 'The Box' was located. They were interrogated, tortured, executed, and their bodies placed in sacks and dropped into the Pacific. Years later, Longan recalled that some of their remains washed back onto shore. The exact number is not known, but, along with Castillo Flores and Gutierrez, the police and military murdered at least thirty people over the course of four days. In July, a defector from the national police told the newspaper El Grafico that execution orders came from Arriaga Bosque, the man in charge of the new US "action unit." \r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;US embassy officials admitted that the killings were carried out under the auspices of Operacion Limpieza. The embassy's March progress report, which enumerated its paragraphs, stated in paragraph number four that the Guatemalan government scored "a considerable success when they captured a number of leading Communists, including Victor Manuel Gutierrez [and] Leonardo Castillo Flores." Paragraph twenty-three then matter-of-factly noted that the police "have conducted 80 raids during the past month using the 'frozen area plan'. The raids have been productive in apprehensions (see paragraph 4)." Despite pleas from Guatemala's archbishop and over 500 petitions of habeas corpus filed by relatives, the government and the American Embassy remained silent about the fate of the executed.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<i>&emsp;Among those eliminated in this first collective Latin American Cold War disappearance were former Arbenz advisors who advocated a negotiated settlement to the still embryonic civil war and a return of the left to the electoral arena. After their executions, a young, Cuba-influenced generation of revolutionaries dismissed such a position as not only naive but suicidal. Even the CIA admitted that an "intolerable status quo" combined with the "efficiency" of the U.S.-cleated security forces drove "usually moderate groups to violence." \r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Operacion Limpieza was a decisive step forward in the radicalization of not just Guatemala's civil war but the broader Latin American Cold War, foreshadowing the application of similar tactics of "disappearances" throughout the continent in the 1970s and 1980s. In Guatemala, it strengthened an intelligence system with central command over death squads that through the course of the civil war would be responsible for tens of thousands of disappearances and executions and countless tortures. It invested awesome power in Arriaga Bosque (one of Guatemala's "most effective and enlightened leaders," according to the American Embassy), who a few months after these executions would lead Guatemala's first scorched-earth campaign (1966-1967) that killed 8,000 civilians, mostly in the eastern lowland part of the country, in order to uproot a few hundred guerrillas." </i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	1966	1966	1	89	Greg Grandin	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:50.027221	2015-02-13 04:07:50.027221	\N

348	Killing the Students	<table style="position:relative;top:-60px;">\r\n<tr><td valign="top">\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="width:510px;margin-top:55px;">\r\n\r\nThe Night of Tlatelolco. \r\nStudents from UNAM and workers in repressed trade unions spent much of the summer demonstrating against police assaults on the autonomy of school campuses, and the general state of repression under the PRI's single party rule. In the beginning of August (during the Mexican school year), tens of thousands of colleged students undertook a notably non-violent march and began an occupation of the university. During massive marches in mid-September, the President sent troops in to violently break up the students' control of the campus and other parts of the city. During the military attacks on the occupation of the Polytechnic campuses on September 23rd, students put up resistance and were fired upon. Fifteen were killed. \r\n<br>\r\nA demonstration was held on October 2nd in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas, ten days before the city was to host the 1968 Olympics. Thousands of soldiers and hundreds of armored trucks and tanks surrounded the students. From hundreds and up to a thousand were gunned down.\r\n<br>\r\nThe repression convinces many activists to carry their struggle underground. Over the next decade, over two dozen urban guerilla groups develop through-out Mexico. The most active guerilla activity is between 1971 and 1975. Most movements disintegrate under brutal repression and a dirty war, which leave over hundreds of activists &quot;disappeared&quot; and over 1,000 dead.\r\n<br>\r\nAn investigation completed in 2001 declared that the army's claim that students fired first from nearby apartments was false, and that it had been Presidential Guard agents who are begun firing at the soldiers to serve as the impetus for the massacre. In 2003, a series of Freedom of Information Act releases proved there was some United States complicity in the overall repression. The day is now remembered in Mexico City as the National Day of Mourning. </p>\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div style="width:530px;">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/tlatelolco-4.jpg" style="width:47%;">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/tlatelolco-3.jpg" style="width:47%;"><br>\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/tlatelolco-1.jpg" style="width:48%;">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/tlatelolco-2.jpg" style=width:47%;"><br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/mexico-68-olympics.png" style=width:40%;">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/tlatelolco-5.jpg"  style=width:56%;">\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n	1968	1968	1	53		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:50.063602	2015-02-13 04:07:50.063602	\N

864	The Rio Treaty	<p class="entry columns">\r\nDuring the late 1940s and 1950s, the stated goal of U.S. military strategy in Latin America was to train and equip security forces to repel an attack by a nonhemispheric power, particularly the Soviet Union. Together with twenty Latin American countries, the United States signed the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, better known as the Rio Treaty, in 1947. The Rio Treaty was one of several mutual defense agreements formulated by the United States, and its main purpose was to organize a united front against an attack. Yet an Holden indicates, "military grant aid was extended to Latin America not to defend it from attack but to help encourage 3 cooperative attitude". The real agenda was less "'hemispheric defense" than a for more traditional concern, the maintenance of U.S. dominance in the Americas and the control over raw materials. This project required political stability and governments willing to cooperate with the United States, and, perhaps more importantly, it entailed suppressing the domestic opponents of friendly regimes. The provision of arms became an important means through which the United States purchased the collaboration of militaries, enhanced their power vis-a-vis domestic challengers, and kept nonhemispheric contenders and weapons suppliers at bay. The commanding general of the Caribbean Defense Command understood the importance of arms sales very well when he noted in a 1045 memo to the War Department that \r\n<br>\r\n<i>it is an established fact that if equipment to supply these armies is not forthcoming in the near future, we face the probability that Mission contacts will not be renewed. It took the war and the elimination of our chief competitors co put us in the unique position we occupy today. Immediate action must be taken to furnish arms and equipment to our Latin American neighbors. Even now we are confronted with the probability of losing the advantage we have gained at high cost and much effort.</i><br>\r\nThe general did not have to worry. Although Latin American commanders had complained of difficulties in securing armaments doting World War II, the postwar era created more favorable conditions for arms sales to the region. Defense manufacturers sought out new markets for their wares, and Congress created generous military aid programs. Facilitating arms transfers not only helped to secure U.S. access to raw materials and the general cooperation of regional militaries, it also tied Latin American militaries to the use, and thus the continued purchase, of technology produced in the United States. The defense establishment referred to the latter as "standardizing" Latin American militaries, and the Caribbean Defense commander put it bluntly when he stated that "standardizing" Latin American armies with U.S. equipment furthered the "penetration of the United States into the military system of any country so that such nation becomes dependent on us.\r\n</p>	1947	1947	1	74	The School of the Americas: Military Training and Political Violence in the Americas	large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:50.076115	2015-02-13 04:07:50.076115	\N

They embarked on a process of collecting archive material—newsreels—and recording testimonies of militants of the so-called Peronist Resistance (a period of popular struggles beginning with Peron's fall in 1955), of intellectuals and university leaders. This search made the filmmakers travel all over the country and was reflected in the film's subtitle, 'Notes and Testimonies on Neocolonialism, Violence and Liberation'.\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout this process (from late 1965 to mid-1968), the directors gradually modified their original proposal and part of their ideas. They incorporated the revisionist view of history and a look on the Peronist working class as the main subject of Argentina's revolutionary transformation. They experienced, as well as many other intellectuals in those years, a journey from the traditional left into a national left. With a new military regime coming to power in 1966, because of the film's adhesion to proscribed Peronism and in particular to its most radicalised wing, its revolutionary proposals and the will to inscribe it into the struggles for social change, they had to resort to an alternative exhibition circuit.\r\n<br>\r\nThe formal organisation of La Hora de los Hornos is inextricably linked to these objectives. Its total running time of four hours 15 minutes is structured into three parts, each with a different formal treatment, theme and even objective. The first section, 'Neocolonialism and Violence', was conceived as an essay film, which discusses the neocolonial nature of Argentine and Latin American dependency through 13 chapters. The second part, 'Act for Liberation', is divided in two, reflecting specific time periods: Chronicle of Peronism and Chronicle of Resistance. Conceived as a film act and dedicated to the 'Peronist proletarians', these two chronicles respectively deal with an analysis of the ten years of Peronism in power (1946-55) and a critical reconstruction of the ensuing struggles (1956-66). The third part, 'Violence and Liberation', dedicated to 'the new man who is being born out of this liberation war', presents itself as a study on the meaning of violence. (<i>The entire film can be found online</i>)</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n&quot;Guerrilla film-making proletarianises the film worker and breaks down the intellectual aristocracy that the bourgeoisie grants to its followers. In a word, it democratises. The film-maker's tie with reality makes him more a part of his people. Vanguard layers and even masses participate collectively in the work when they realise that it is the continuity of their daily struggle. La hora de los hornos shows how a film can be made in hostile circumstances when it has the support and collaboration of militants and cadres from the people.\r\n<br>\r\n&quot;The revolutionary film-maker acts with a radically new vision of the role of the producer, team-work, tools, details, etc. Above all, he supplies himself at all levels in order to produce his films, he equips himself at all levels, he learns how to handle the manifold techniques of his craft. His most valuable possessions are the tools of his trade, which form part and parcel of his need to communicate. The camera is the inexhaustible expropriator of image-weapons; the projector, a gun that can shoot 24 frames per second.&quot; —Directors Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino &quot;Towards a Third Cinema&quot;\r\n</p>	1968	1968	9	3		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:50.10268	2015-02-13 04:07:50.10268	\N

Violence and disease, the advance guard of civilization: for the Indian, contact with the white man continues to be contact with death. Every legal dispensation since 1537 meant to protect Brazil's Indians has been turned against them. Under every Brazilian constitution they are &quot;the original and natural masters&quot; of the land they occupy, but the richer that virgin land proves to be, the greater the threat hanging over their lives. Nature's very generosity makes them targets of plunder and crime. Indian hunting has become ferocious in recent years; the world's greatest forest, a huge tropical zone open to legend and adventure, has inspired a new &quot;American dream.&quot; Men and business enterprises from the United States, a new procession of conquistadores, have poured into Amazonia as if it were another Far West. This U.S. invasion has inflamed the avarice of Brazilian adventurers as never before. The Indians die out leaving no trace, and the land is sold for dollars to the new interested parties. Gold and other plentiful minerals, timber and rubber, riches whose commercial value the Indians are not even aware of, recur in the reports of each of the few investigations that have been made. It is known that the Indians have been machine-gunned from helicopters and light airplanes and inoculated with smallpox virus, that dynamite has been tossed into their villages, and that they have been given gifts of sugar mixed with strychnine and salt mixed with arsenic. The director of the Indian Protection Service, named by the Castelo Branco dictatorship to clean up its administration, was himself accused, with proof, of committing forty-two different kinds of crimes against the Indians. That scandal broke in 1968.</p>	1968	1968	2	22	Open Veins of Latin America, Galeano	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:50.134177	2015-02-13 04:07:50.134177	\N

359	American Business and Brazilian Torture	<p class="entry columns" style="position:absolute;top:415px;">The United States was the &quot;regime's most reliable ally,&quot; Thomas Skidmore observes in the most comprehensive scholarly study of what came next. US aid &quot;saved the day&quot; for the ruling Generals; the process also &quot;turned the U.S. into a kind of unilateral IMF, overseeing every aspect of Brazilian economic policy.&quot; &quot;In almost every Brazilian office involved in administering unpopular tax, wage, or price decisions, there was the ubiquitous American adviser,&quot; the new US Ambassador discovered in 1966. Once again, the US was well-positioned to use Brazil as a &quot;testing area for modern scientific methods of industrial development&quot; (Haines), and therefore has every right to take credit for what ensued. Under US guidance, Brazil pursued orthodox neoliberal policies, &quot;doing everything right&quot; by monetarist criteria, and &quot;strengthening the market economy&quot; (Skidmore). The &quot;economic miracle&quot; proceeded in parallel with the entrenchment of the fascist National Security State, not accidentally; a regime that could not wield the knout could hardly have carried out measures with such a deleterious impact on the population. <br>\r\n<font style="color:#cc0000">The President announced in 1970 that repression would be &quot;harsh and implacable,&quot; with no rights for &quot;pseudo-Brazilians.&quot; Torture became &quot;a grisly ritual, a calculated onslaught against body and soul,&quot; Skidmore writes, with such specialties as torture of children and gang rape of wives before the family. The &quot;orgy of torture&quot; provided &quot;a stark warning&quot; to anyone with the wrong thoughts. It was a &quot;powerful instrument,&quot; that &quot;made it even easier for Delfim and his technocrats to avoid public debate over fundamental economic and social priorities&quot; while they &quot;preached the virtues of the free market.&quot;</font> The resumption of high economic growth, by these means, made Brazil &quot;again attractive to foreign private investors,&quot; who took over substantial parts of the economy. By the late 1970s, &quot;The industries dominated by local capital in Brazil [were] the same industries where small businesses flourish in the United States&quot;; multinationals and their local associates dominated the more profitable growth areas, though with the changes in the global economy, about 60 percent of foreign capital was then non-US (Peter Evans). </p>	1970	1970	5	16	Year 501, Noam Chomsky	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:50.15999	2015-02-13 04:07:50.15999	\N

One of those groups, formed after the first Reagan inauguration, was the U.S. Council for World Freedom (USCWF), headed by Major General John Singlaub. \r\n<br>\r\nThe USCWF quickly became the U.S. branch of the World Anti-Communist League (WACL). The USCWF began building support for the Reagan policy of aiding not only the Nicaraguan Contras but RENAMO and UNITA in southern Africa and rightist Islamic fundamentalists in Afghanistan. Singlaub informed Central Intelligence Agency director William Casey and National Security Council staff of his actions and operated with their assent, if not under their direction.\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/waclconvention1981.jpg" style="padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;"><br>\r\n<span class="caption"> A World Anti-Communist League Convention</span>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the early USCWF financial backers was Joe Coors (Yes, of Coors Beer), according to two former USCWF treasurers. Coors shared Reagan's enthusiasm for the Contras despite early indications of the unsavory background of certain Contra leaders and reliable reports of Contra acts of brutality. The Contras were originally known as the 15th of September Legion. Their earliest training came from Argentinian military intelligence, which ran death squads in that country and sponsored a Latin American conference of death squad leaders in 1980. That death squad network was also the Latin American branch of WACL. In 1982, Argentinian intelligence worked with Moon's Unification Church and fugitive Nazi Klaus Barbie to establish a Nazi-style state in Bolivia.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="The NFF"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="column-fill:balance">\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/reagancontra1985.jpg" style="height:20%;padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;"><br>\r\n<span class="caption"> Ronald Reagan with a Contra leader (and CIA agent), Adolfo Calero, in 1985</span><br><br>\r\nReliable international monitoring groups have reported that the Contras killed thousands of peasants, slaughtered cattle, and created terror in an apparent effort to undermine the confidence of the Nicaraguan people in their government. Contra project officers in Washington created a covert financial support apparatus run by Oliver North and his superiors. A public financial support apparatus coordinated by Singlaub was also tied into the White House, Joe Coors worked with both fundraising networks. Joe Coors was one of the boosters of a big fundraising dinner for the Contras in 1985 arranged by the Nicaraguan Refugee Fund at which Reagan was the keynote speaker. The Fund was set up by the Contras' fundraising arm and promoted by a public relations firm whose founder had long-standing Central Intelligence Agency links.\r\n<br>\r\nCoors also contributed to the Nicaraguan Freedom Foundation (NFF), established by the Moon-owned Washington Times. Board members of NFF included Jeane Kirkpatrick, William Simon, and Michael Novak. Simon and Novak were on the board of PRODEMCA, which also funneled money to the Contras. Jeane Kirkpatrick and her husband Byron Kirkpatrick publish a quarterly magazine, World Affairs, which has published an article endorsing the use of death squads. The Christian Broadcast Network (CBN), whose Regent University is supported by the Coors Foundation and has Holly Coors on its board, was one of the largest donors to the Contra cause, giving millions of dollars to the Contras in Central America (the Nicaraguan Freedom Foundation funds went there as well). Christian Broadcast Network owner Pat Robertson held a telethon on May 30, 1985 to raise funds for the Contras.\r\n<img src="/mapimages/contracamp1984-1.jpg" style="padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;"><br>\r\n<span class="caption"> Contra Camp, 1984</span><br>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="The Conservatives"></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/contracamp1984-2.jpg" style="padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;"><br>\r\n<span class="caption"> Contra Camp, 1984</span><br>\r\nAnother active Contra support group was Citizens for America, cochaired by Lewis Lehrman and Holly Coors. Citizens for America was formed in coordination with the White House in 1983 to build support for Reagan's programs. In 1985, it organized a tour of twenty Contras to two hundred congressional districts to lobby for Contra funding. Lehrman also organized a June 2, 1985 meeting in Angola that brought together the Nicaraguan Contras, the South African-backed UNITA leaders, and similar rightist groups from around the world.\r\n<br>\r\nOther Coors-funded groups that have actively supported the Contras include the Heritage Foundation, the Free Congress Foundation, and The Conservative Caucus (TCC). TCC has said for example, "The Conservative Caucus has advocated a strategy of victory over Communism in Nicaragua from the very beginning&#8212;and we will continue to press for aid to the Contras, de-recognition of the Sandinistas, and a new government, friendly to the United States."\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/olivernorthtcchowardphillips1981.jpg" style="height:40%;padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;"><br>\r\n<font class="caption">Oliver North with The Conservative Caucus's Howard Phillips, this photo was used in fundraising appeals.</font><br><br>\r\nJoe Coors also became involved with Oliver North in the clandestine Contra support networks. On May 21, 1987, he told Congress that he met with Central Intelligence Agency director William Casey, on June 18, 1985, to offer support for the Contras. (Coors knew Casey from the 1980 presidential campaign and had been funding the National Strategy Information Center with which Casey had worked.) Casey directed Coors to Oliver North, who got Coors to buy a small airplane for the Contras. Coors then transferred $65,000 from his account to the Lake Resources account in Switzerland controlled by North.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="The Heritage Criminals"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="height:650px">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/contracamp1984-3.jpg" style="padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;"><br>\r\n<span class="caption"> Contra Camp, 1984</span><br>\r\n\r\nThe Heritage Foundation was also involved in the secret Contra funding schemes. Heritage in 1985 "donated" $100,000 to the Institute for North. South Issues (INSI), an Oliver North-connected conduit. From INSI, $80,000 of the money went to the account of LC., Inc., a North-Spitz Channell conduit to the Contras. The $100,000 came from a private con-tributor contacted by Roy Godson, a National Security Council consultant and director of the National Strategy Information Center. A Congressional report noted, "The true objective of this 'grant' was disguised in correspondence between (Richard) Miller (as Treasurer of INSI) and Edwin J. Feulner (as president of Heritage Foundation) with whom Godson had met previously."<br>\r\nThe "private" aid that Coors and others provided to the Contras appeared to violate U.S. neutrality laws which state: <br><i>\r\nWhoever, within the United States, knowingly begins or sets on foot [sic) or provides or prepares a means for or furnishes the money for, or takes part in, any military or naval expedition or enterprise to be carried on from thence against the territory or dominion of any foreign prince or state, or of any colony, district, or people with whom the United States is at peace, shall be fined not more than $3,000 or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\r\n</i><br>\r\n In fact, several other private individuals supplying aid to the Contras have been prosecuted. Spitz Channell and members of Civilian Military Assistance, for example, have been indicted for the violation of federal laws. In 1985, Jack Terrel, a leader of a civilian commando unit that aided the Contras and himself indicted in the Iran-Contra scandal, revealed that "Coors brewery is one of the Contras' biggest supporters."\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/joecoorsandednoble.gif" style="padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;"><br>\r\n<span class="caption"> Ed Noble and Joseph Coors, founders of the Heritage Foundation</span>\r\n\r\n</p>	1981	1981	5	74	The Coors Connection: How Coors Family Philanthropy Undermines Democratic Pluralism by Russ Bellant	large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:50.195492	2015-02-13 04:07:50.195492	\N
870	Father Antonio Vieiria	<div class="page" data-title="The Descent"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="background-color:white;padding:7px;margin-top:80px;'">\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/padrevieira.jpg" class="floatright" style="max-width:50%;">\r\n&emsp;\r\nThe Jesuits planned to operate in Para, but their hopes were frustrated\r\nwhen a ship carrying their Provincial Luis Figueira and eleven\r\nfathers foundered in full view of Beiem in 1643 and the missionaries\r\nwere captured and killed by hostile Aruan Indians of Marajo Island. It\r\nwas ten years before the Jesuits returned; but they did so in 1653 in\r\nthe towering person of Antonio Vieira. Vieira was a Brazilian-born\r\nJesuit who had risen to be the close confidant and confessor of Dom\r\nJoao IV of Portugal. He was famous for the brilliance of his sermons\r\nat a time when the pulpit was the most potent medium of communication.\r\nVieira had been entrusted with secret diplomatic missions in Europe,\r\nand his was the most influential voice in shaping Portuguese foreign\r\npolicy. It came as a surprise when this powerful man suddenly vowed\r\nto take up missionary field work, and actually sailed for the backwater\r\nof the Amazon.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAntonio Vieira was appalled by the conditions he found in Maranhao\r\nand Para. He preached fiery sermons against expeditions to 'rescue' or\r\n'ransom' Indians which were really slaving expeditions and condemned\r\nany settlers who kept Indian slaves: 'All of you are in mortal sin; all\r\nof you live in a state of condemnation; and all of you are going directly\r\nto Hell!' But his eloquence was wasted on colonists who had no\r\nintention of giving up any Indians and who were constantly clamouring\r\nfor more native labor. After a journey up the Tocantins, Vieira\r\nreturned to Portugal and persuaded the vacillating king to enact new\r\nlegislation (1655) against Indian enslavement. The Jesuits were entrusted\r\nwith the task of bringing the Indians from the interior by peaceful means\r\nand establishing them in mission villages under their control. Five years\r\nof euphoric activity ensued for the Jesuits. The Fathers accompanied\r\nexpeditions up all the main tributaries of the lower Amazon and far up\r\nthe Rio Negro, and they had soon 'descended' some 200,000 Indians into 54 mission aldeias. The tribes came willingly, impressed by the\r\nreputation of the Jesuits and by their promises of material prosperity\r\nand religious enlightenment. The descents were, however, murderous\r\ndeceptions. Many Indians died of alien diseases during the voyages\r\ndown to Belem; but the missionaries consoled themselves that these\r\nvictims of their misguided policy had at least received baptism before\r\ndying. Once settled in aldeias near Portuguese towns, the Indians were\r\nexposed to constant demands for their labor. Crowded into these\r\nsettlements, they were particularly vulnerable to smallpox and measles,\r\nepidemics of which occurred with dismal regularity. The Jesuits could\r\nnot reconcile the fundamental contradiction that stifted any royal wish\r\nfor humane treatment of the Indians. The small European colonies in\r\nBrazil could not prosper without native labor and could not ward off\r\nattack by hostile tribes or rival colonial powers without docile native\r\nauxiliaries. The settlers knew that they could make the Indians work\r\nfor them only by force; and in the impoverished Amazon they were\r\ntoo poor to afford African slaves. \r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="17 Years"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="background-color:white;padding:7px;margin-top:160px;'">\r\n\r\n&emsp;\r\nLife in this region depended on river\r\ntransport and on fish and game, gums, fruits, and resins extracted from\r\nthe forests. For such activities local Indians were far better than\r\nimported Africans. The Jesuits deluded themselves that the Indians in\r\ntheir missions would become loyal Christian subjects of Portugal. But\r\nthey knew in practice that they were condemning them to forced labor\r\nand rapid destruction from disease, demoralization, malnutrition and\r\nsocial disruption.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nVieira himself performed two missions of which he was proud. In 1659 he undertook an embassy to the tribes of Marajo Island, who were known collectively as Nheengaiba (Tupi for 'incomprehensible\r\nlanguages'). These tribes had successfully resisted repeated Portuguese\r\npunitive expeditions, usually by disappearing into the labyrinth of\r\nchannels on their island. Forty thousand of them now surrendered,\r\naccepting Vieira's assurances that Portuguese attitudes had changed\r\nwith the new law of 1655. The Jesuits established themselves on Marajo,\r\nwhere their huge cattle ranches prospered, to the envy of the colonists\r\nand eventually of the government in Lisbon. In 1660 Vieira made a\r\ndifficult journey to the remote Ibiapaba hills on the border between\r\nMaranhao and Ceara. He confronted the remnants of the north-eastern\r\nIndians who had fled there after the departure of the Dutch. All but\r\nthe oldest accepted conversion to Catholicism and the presence of Jesuit\r\nmissionaries.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n<img src="/mapimages/guaranibrazil.jpg" class="floatleft" style="max-width:50%;">\r\nThe Jesuits' efforts to accommodate settlers' demands for Indian\r\nlabor were in vain. Colonists who had hoped to make their fortune in the Amazon were defeated by the difficult conditions and climate.\r\nAs they saw their riverside clearings fail, they vented their frustration\r\non the jesuits, pious busybodies who seemed to be thwarting their\r\nsupply of fresh Indian labor. Their fury erupted in May 1661 with a\r\nrising in Sao Lur do Maranhao against the Jesuit Fathers. Vieira and\r\nmost of his men were arrested and shipped off to Portugal. A new law\r\nof September 12 1663 installed lay <i>repartidores</i> in Indian villages to\r\noversee the allocation of men to work on settlers' holdings. It was\r\nseventeen years before Vieira was able to influence a new king, Pedro\r\nII, to reinstate the jesuits in full control of Indian aldeias and to forbid\r\nall forms of Indian slavery. During those years irreparable damage had\r\nbeen done to the Indians under Portuguese rule. \r\n</p>	1653	1678	3	16	Colonial Brazil By Leslie Bethell	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:50.202654	2015-02-13 04:07:50.202654	\N

The latter resulted in a seminar on "Christian Faith and the Sandinista Revolution", organized by the Central American university and the Central American historical institute in Managua in 1979, where Father Amando López coordinated sessions that involved the participation of both Sandinista commanders and Christian theologians.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nBut the main and richest theological debate of the 1970s arose from the preparatory document for the third Latin American bishops conference, in Puebla, Mexico, in 1979. According to historian Enrique Dussel, "this is, perhaps, the most important theological debate that has taken place in the history of Latin American theology" since the one started by Las Casas and Sepúlveda in Spain during the period of colonial domination. Puebla, with newly elected Pope John Paul II in attendance, was the second bishops conference to develop and approve the church's preferential option for the poor and place itself squarely and openly in solidarity with workers and campesinos and all Latin Americans who were living under repression. The theology of liberation was fully affirmed by most bishops, as well as ecumenical solidarity. The debates were lively and open and watched closely by the new pope and the Vatican as a section of conservative bishops close to military regimes and those thought to be part of Opus Dei, the growing reactionary movement in the Roman Catholic Church which had originated in Spain, attempted to return to old roles where church and state were close and interdependent. That part of the church played the part of chaplaincy to the established order, following unquestioningly the oppressive regimes.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOf particular concern to the Puebla meeting was the place of Indigenous Peoples throughout the region and especially in Guatemala, <img src="/mapimages/puebla1979pope.jpg" class="floatright">\r\nBolivia, Nicaragua and other countries where Indians existed in large numbers and were among the poorest and most exploited of all Latin Americans.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nPuebla came at a critical time for Protestant and Catholic churches to work together for justice and peace as a priority of the churches' mission. Once again, Protestant observers were invited and one working group on dialogue for communion and participation dealt specifically with the issue of ecumenism. In the Puebla document concrete references to the practice of ecumenism appear, in several forms: "practical social", "spiritual", "doctrinal", "biblical", "dialogue" and "witness" ecumenism.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nPuebla, however, established clear limits for ecumenical dialogue. According to the document, ecumenism should take place at the institutional level and for many bishops this was the only form of ecumenical manifestation allowed. In that perspective, ecumenism emanating from the grassroots was marginalized, ignored and often rejected because it "overstepped" those boundaries.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe pontificate of John Paul II has been marked by a determination to reinsert the Church and its beliefs into elements of human life from which secularism sought to expel them. (John Paul is ably assisted in this endeavor by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, whom the Pope appointed head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.  Ratzinger authored a two-part refutation of liberation theology in the 1984 <i>Instruction on Certain Aspects of the "Theology of Liberation"</i> and the <i>Instruction on Christian Freedom and Liberation</i> that came out two years later.) John Paul's main enemy, since his election in 1978, has been modern secularism. For the Pope, liberation theology is part of this secularism.\r\n</p>	1978	1979	3	54		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:50.286595	2015-02-13 04:07:50.286595	\N

367	Evictions, Broken Strikes, Soldiers, and the AFL-CIO	<p class="entry columns" style="font-size:.87em">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/domrep1971specialforces.jpg" class="floatright" style="width:70%;height:70%;">\r\n\r\n&emsp;One of the Dominican Republic model is effective government pacification of the labor force, a crucial requirement for an appropriate &quot;climate of investment.&quot; As noted above, the systematic police terror since 1965 has returned the large urban proletariat and sub-proletariat to the desired state of passivity, and the countryside has been more easily kept in line by periodic violence and threats. The Dominican Republic advertisement section in the New York Times of January 28, 1973, has a heading entitled &quot;Industrialists Dream of Chances Like These,&quot; featuring the low, low wage rates, running between 25 and 50 cents an hour. The ad stresses the role of the law in fixing hours and wages and allowing the free import of foreign technicians. There is no mention of any trade unions, but employers will properly read between the lines that unions have been broken and pacified (with the assistance of George Meany and the AFL-CIO). Of special interest is the regular use of government troops and police to break up independent unions. The agricultural union Sindicato Unido, which operated the fields now owned by G &amp; W was broken by police action in 1966 and 1967, and a number of its leaders, including the union lawyer Guido Gil were arrested and killed by the forces of law and order. \r\n<br>&emsp;Another major foreign enterprise, Falconbridge Nickel, also successfully broke a union with army and police assistance in 1970. A Wall Street Journal report of September 9, 1971 states that &quot;when a union attempted to organize construction workers at a foreign-owned ferronickel mill project last year, Mr. Balaguer sent in the army to help straighten things out. While the soldiers kept order, the contractors fired 32 allegedly leftist leaders...The strike was broken in eight days.&quot; Matters had not changed much in the mid-70s. An ad hoc human rights group that visited the Dominican Republic in 1975 reported that &quot;working people have been prevented by nearly every conceivable means from forming and joining trade union organizations.&quot; <strong>A union organizing effort in the G &amp; W free trade zone in the mid-1970s was broken with the help of the police in arresting, jailing, and deporting labor organizers, and with the use of &quot;troops in full combat gear armed with submachine guns&quot; to break up organizing meetings.</strong> Flannery states that:\r\n<i>\r\n&quot;Officials of the Dominican labor ministry told organizers that—contrary to the paper guarantees of the republic's laws—workers would not be allowed to form a union in the industrial free zone.&quot;\r\n</i>\r\nOn the matter of labor unions, the 1977 State Department Human Rights Report has the following &quot;information&quot;: \r\n<i>\r\n&quot;Labor unions are permitted to function and numerous labor unions exist including some associated with opposition parties, but under some government controls.&quot;</i> That exhausts that topic.\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;In containing unions and rendering them docile the Dominican elite has had the steadfast support of the top echelons of the AFL-CIO, which has long cooperated closely with the CIA and international business firms in this unsavory operation. Its arm CONATRAL actually helped destroy the pro-labor Bosch regime in 1963 and has steadily supported its totalitarian and anti-labor successors.&quot;' Presumably their blind hatred of Communism and radicalism in general has led Meany and his close followers to sell out systematically the interests of labor in the Dominican Republic and in other U. S. satellites. \r\n<br>&emsp;Meany and some other labor bosses actually have a more direct interest in the pacification of labor in the Dominican Republic. Meany, his number two man Lane Kirkland, Alexander Barkan, director of COPE, the AFL-CIO political arm, and Edward J. Carlough, president of the sheet metal workers, all are stockholders in the 15,000 acre Punta Cana resort and plantation in the Dominican Republic. In order to clear the ground for this enterprise designed for the Beautiful People a large numbers of squatters were evicted by the army.</p>\r\n<p style="font-size:small;"><i>Pictured</i>: A soldier of the Mobile Training Team, U.S. Special Forces, uses an AN/PRC-10 radio to keep in touch with other members of the patrol during a training exercise with forces in the Dominican Republic in 1971.</p>\r\n	1971	1976	5	38	The Washington Connection and Third World Fascism by Noam Chomsky and Ed Herman	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:50.316174	2015-02-13 04:07:50.316174	\N

As they  exited the airport, the protestors threw stones and physically attacked the bishops. It  quickly became clear that the entire incident had been organized by the DINA. The  bishops recognized one protestor as an aid to Pinochet and saw another drop a blank  detention order. \r\n<br>\r\nThe Permanent Committee of the Episcopal Conference was swift in issuing a  condemnation of the incident. The declaration expressed the bishops’ “indignation” at  the protests and affirmed that the punishment for perpetrating violence against a  bishop is automatic excommunication; however, the declaration went further and for  the first time expressed a candid criticism of the regime itself. The bishops asserted  that the abuses taking place were not spontaneous or accidental but were rooted in the  very nature of military government.\r\n<br>\r\n<span class="blockquote" style="font-style:italic;">\r\nThe actions that we denounce and condemn are not isolated.

591	The Partido Revolucionario de Unificacion Democratica is Founded	<div class="page" data-title="The First Coup..."></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="background-color:white;">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/oscarosorioyrichardnixon.jpg" class="floatright" style="width:100%;">\r\nIn 1948, The Partido Revolucionario de Unificacion Democratica (Revolutionary Party of Democratic Unification-PRUD) is founded in El Salvador aand led by Colonel Oscar Osorio.\r\nIn the 1948 coup led by Colonel Oscar Osorio. the modernizers came to power. Two years later Osorio was elected\r\npresident. He was the perfect symbol of the new era, his closely cropped crew cut suggesting the modern soldier-cum-technocrat. And his ideas were grandiose. Size was no obstacle: El Salvador could become the Belgium of Central America, pouring coffee profits into industry, building roads and dams and generators. It was to be a revolution, many said, and even the Communist Party of El Salvador described it as such: “the beginning of the bourgeois-democratic era, the triumph of the capitalist class over the feudal and semi-feudal landowning oligarchy. The bourgeoisie finally had come to power.“\r\n<br>\r\nThe Osorio government gradually developed a three-pronged strategy that would remain the framework of rule in El Salvador for decades to come: <i>developmentalism</i>—the creation of conditions to permit the expansion and modernization of the economy; <i>reformism</i>—the policy of adjusting existing political and social structures to keep the system one step ahead of its own contradictions; and <i>repression</i>—reserved for those who could not be coopted and wanted more than ameliorative change.\r\n<br>\r\nAs the first order of business, Osorio repealed the anti-industry laws of the Martinez era and replaced them with strong incentives to invest in new sectors. The power and size of the state bureaucracy was greatly expanded, as new offices were set up to coordinate the development of commerce, industry and mining, and taxes were imposed on coffee exports to feed new areas of investment. .\r\nA modern infrasmicture began to talte shape, with the building of the giant Fifth of November dam on the Lempa River, to provide cheap electrical power to the cities. And a highway running the length of the Paciﬁc coast opened new lands to the production of cotton and cattle. The peasants displaced by these new activities were a source of cheap labor  to industry. bent on competing with imported manufactured goods for the small national market.\r\n<br>\r\nBut as plans for industrializing the country got under way the modernizers retained the memory of l932—of the alliance of workers and peasants that channeled discontent into organized rebellion. The labor movement in El Salvador was alive and growing, and The Salvodorean Committee for Trade Union Organizing (Spanish Acronym: CROSS) had become a force that the Osorio government set out to tame.\r\n<br>\r\nThe Constitution of 1950 reflected both the strength of the working class and the government‘s attempt to coopt it. The new constitution granted, at least on paper. the right to organize unions within very strict limits; the right to strike; the right to a minimum wage, social security beneﬁts and subsidized housing. None of these rights were extended to the rural sector. which remained unchanged in every respect. That was part of the deal with the agro-front, the price for their support of modernization.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="caption" style="width:440px;position:relative;left:550px;style="background-color:white;"">The Vice President Richard M. Salvadoran President Nixon and Oscar Osorio exchanged a photograph.

Based on a concept of harmonious cooperation between labor and capital, and boosted by government favors, a new federation was established by 1958, called the General Confederation of Salvadorean Unions (CGS). This was intended to compete with the more radical General Workers Confederation (CC-TS) formed a year earlier.\r\n<br>\r\nThe process of modernization gradually created more layers between the very rich and the very poor in El Salvador. The rapid expansion of the state bureaucracy stimulated the growth of a middle class; industrial growth began to enlarge the small, still mainly artisan working class. The modernizers needed a vehicle to legitimize their rule and integrate these new sectors of society into their "revolution."<br>\r\nColonel Osorio had lived in Mexico and admired the ability of the PRI (Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party) in drawing diverse sectors into its ranks. El Salvador's PRUD—the Revolutionary Party of Democratic Uniﬁcation—was Osorio's brainchild. He made it the political vehicle of the modernizing alliance, running military candidates for president and using the military command structure as a\r\npolitical machine.‘ \r\n<br>\r\nOsorio and the modernizers also proceeded to replace the decades-long reign of tyrants with the stability of a single-term presidency and smooth succession every ﬁve years. They allowed small opposition parties to emerge, representing dissident factions of the oligarchy that wanted a return to civilian rule.‘ But they were no match for the massive machinery of the PRUD. In 1956 Osorio's hand-picked successor, Colonel josé Maria Lemus, was elected on the PRUD ticket by an overwhelming margin.\r\n<br>\r\nThe small reforms of the modernizers never replaced the need for repression. In 1952 Colonel Osorio outlawed the CROSS after brief and unsuccessful efforts to coopt its leadership. But the repression in this period was still subtle and selective. It was always justified by “a great conspiracy, a communist coup discovered in the nick of time," wrote one of its victims, the baker and labor leader, Salvador Cayetano Carpio, arrested and tortured in 1952.\r\n<br>\r\nBut Colonel Lemus was less sophisticated and more corrupt than Osorio. His term coincided with a sharp downturn in the economy: worldwide recession reached El Salvador in the late 1950s, sending coffee prices to rock bottom and disappointing the popular hopes inflated by the fanfare of 1950. And then came Cuba—that unexpected island of revolution that burst upon the scene in 1959. Castro's victory provoked demands for harsher measures from the Oligarchy. Students began protesting in the streets; workers began organizing Action Committees in their unions.<br>\r\nOn October 26, 1960, Colonel Jose Maria Lemus was informed by army couriers that his presence no longer served the national interest. Junior officers had decided to act.\r\n\r\n</p>	1948	1956	1	76	El Salvador: The Face of Revolution  By Robert Armstrong and Janet Shenk	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:50.413295	2015-02-13 04:07:50.413295	\N

From March 1976 to 1983, the junta increased Argentina's foreign debt from $7.2 billion to nearly $46 billion, raising their country's debt-income ration from ten to fifty percent and boosting the cost of debt services to a record seven percent. To pull this off, the junta required the active assistance of numerous major banks, including Bank of Boston, Citibank, Bankers Trust, Bank of America, Morgan, Lloyds, UBS/SBC, Deutsch Bank, Barclays Bank and BNP.\r\n<br>\r\nBut  its best friend by far was Chase Manhattan's CEO and chairman David Rockefeller Sr. Chase loaned the junta more than $800 million directly and syndicated billions more, becoming the leader in Argentine loan syndication during this period. Moreover, the junta's key economic minister Jose Martinus de Hoz (&quot;Joe, the Wizard of Hoz&quot;) was a former senior advisor to Chase and a very close friend of Rockefeller's.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="caption"><i>Pictured, David Rockefeller</i></p>	1977	1977	5	7	The Washington Connection and Third World Fascism</i>, Noam Chomsky and <br>Edward Herman and <i>The Blood Bankers, James S.

Hours later, on March 24, they overthrow and imprison Isabel Peron. The governor of the province of La Rioja, Carlos Menem, and other Peronist leaders, are confined to a navy prison ship anchored in the port of Buenos Aires. Once again, the Congress and the Supreme Court are dissolved. Clandestine concentration camps are set up in units of the armed and security forces, and those who are abducted are taken to them, always secretly and without any judicial order. There they are tortured, then covertly murdered. In a meeting of the bishopric, Tortolo defends torture with theological arguments.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;The military junta designates the chief of the army, General Jorge Videla, to be president, but the junta is being torn apart by internal conflicts.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Old jealousies are erupting between the army and the navy, led by Admiral Emilio Massera, who maintains that the junta is the organ of maximum power and Videla no more than its delegated administrator. In the plans approved by the military junta, it falls to the army to command the operations of the dirty war, and the jurisdictions are clearly determined. But Massera does not respect those agreements and invades the jurisdiction of the army as a way of accumulating intramilitary power. His instrument for doing so is the Navy School of Mechanics (ESMA), where a clandestine concentration camp is operating. The task force that administers it answers directly to the chief of the navy, who personally participates in certain operations.  \r\nIn June, an army patrol brings down the leader of the ERP, Roberto Sanrucho, and the dismantling of that organization is complete.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<font style="font-size:small;">\r\n<i>\r\n<b>March 24, 1976</b> Gen.

542	The United Provinces of Central America	<div class="page" data-title="another page"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\n&emsp;\r\nMexico, in its declaration of independence, had annexed all\r\nthe provinces of New Spain within its newly formed empire. Central\r\nAmerica understood the threat behind Mexico’s request that it proclaim\r\nitself part of the empire. Without the resources to offer resistance,\r\nCentral America accepted its neighbors’ troops in Guatemala City\r\nunder the authority of a Mexican governor, Brigadier General Vicente\r\nFilísola, <i>pictured</i>. The Central Americans, fortunately, benefited from many provisions\r\nin the new Mexican constitution, including the abolition of all\r\nslavery and tribute and the establishment of free trade.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nCentral America was not of a single mind in regard to Mexican annexation,\r\nalthough many interest groups and regions found it an attractive\r\noption. Most town councils favored it and elected deputies to represent\r\nthem in the Mexican congress; the respected José del Valle was the most\r\nillustrious of the deputies. Many conservatives favored annexation,\r\nbecause they thought it would preserve their privileges just as they had\r\nbeen under Spain—only the crown now was worn by a creole. Many\r\nbelieved that Mexico’s homegrown emperor, Agustín Iturbide, would\r\nprovide the central authority necessary to avoid the provincial conflicts\r\nthat threatened to divide the isthmus. Others hoped that Mexico’s\r\nwealth would help to strengthen the Central American economy.\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe issue failed to touch the vast majority of Indians and rural poor.\r\nYet some groups in the western highlands, such as the Quichés of\r\nMomostenango, actively supported annexation and were loyal to\r\nFilísola, who permitted the rebel Mayans to control local affairs. \r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/carvicentefilisola.jpg">\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nCosta\r\nRica proclaimed its neutrality on the matter. A few important cities,\r\nTegucigalpa and Granada among them, and the most ardent liberals,\r\nsuch as Pedro Molina of Guatemala and Miguel José Arce of El Salvador,\r\nopposed annexation. San Salvador, daring to declare its intention of\r\nattaching itself to the United States rather than to Mexico, was quickly\r\noccupied by the Mexican army in San Salvador to quell any chance of\r\ninsurrection.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nFilísola successfully annexed El Salvador in 1823, but Mexico was in\r\nno position to sustain the fight for Central America and could not even\r\npay the troops stationed in Guatemala City, much less force compliance\r\nin Granada or faraway Costa Rica. Iturbide proved more of a buffoon\r\nthan a monarch. Soon after the Salvadoran uprising, the emperor was\r\ndeposed. Not knowing what else to do, Governor Filísola convened a\r\nCentral American congress that was mandated by the Mexican constitution.\r\nOn July 1, 1823, the congress convened and immediately declared\r\nits independence from Mexico. Chiapas, the only province to dissent,\r\nremained part of Mexico. To get rid of the unpaid Mexican troops in the\r\ncapital, however, the residents of Guatemala City had to raise thousands\r\nof pesos to pay for their trip north.\r\n<br>&emsp;With the overthrow of Iturbide, Central America declares itself independent of Mexico as the United Provinces of Central America (also known as\r\nthe Federal Republic of Central America). \r\nAt a meeting of the Constituent\r\nAssembly held in 1824 Jose Simeon Canas y Villacorta, a deputy from\r\nEl Salvador, pleaded that without further delay it should be made clear\r\nthat ‘our enslaved brothers should be declared free citizens’.53 The\r\nmeasure actually adopted decreed that slaves could no longer be born in\r\nCentral America and established a fund to promote slave manumission.\r\nOver the next two decades the United Provinces broke up into the\r\nseparate states of Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and\r\nCosta Rica. None of the successor states sought to challenge the\r\nabolitionist provisions of 1824 and the subsequent development of a\r\nmodest cash crop sector in agriculture did not depend on slave labour.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="another page"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOnce independent, Central America was confronted with true independence—\r\nand the tug of disparate interests. With no king and an empty\r\ntreasury, the former colony faced the choice between unity and division\r\ninto five autonomous states: Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras,\r\nNicaragua, and Costa Rica. (Belize theoretically remained part of\r\nGuatemala even though the British occupied its coastal regions;\r\nPanama was part of Colombia.)\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nFilísola’s congress, transforming itself into a constitutional assembly,\r\noptimistically declared the new sovereign nation of the United\r\nProvinces of Central America under the banner of God, Unity, and\r\nLiberty. This vote reflected the hopefulness and experimentation that\r\nmarked the first years of the republic. Full of the idealism of the\r\nEnlightenment, the Central Americans engaged in lively debates about\r\nthe best direction for the future. Most recognized that the individual\r\nprovinces were too small and too weak economically to survive as sovereign\r\nstates, so the fractious liberals and conservatives seriously negotiated\r\nwith one another to avert such a fragmentation of the isthmus.\r\nDespite the Conservative Party majority in the assembly (46 to 13\r\nLiberals), a liberal constitution was agreed upon on November 22,\r\n1824, based on the federal principles of the United States of America.\r\nAnd to put some money in the treasury, a five-million-peso loan was\r\nnegotiated with a bank in London.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n&emsp;\r\nOne problem confronting a unified government was the distrust the\r\nprovinces had for the vested interests in Guatemala City. This was such\r\na persistent issue that the federal capital was eventually relocated to San\r\nSalvador. A further serious obstacle to representational government was\r\nthe imbalance in population and physical size of the member states.\r\nGuatemala, already despised for its concentration of power, accounted\r\nfor 40 percent of the population. When the federal congress convened in\r\n1825, the number of delegates for each province reflected the problem:\r\n18 for Guatemala, 9 for El Salvador, 6 each for Honduras and Nicaragua,\r\nand 2 for Costa Rica. The Senate, with two members from each state,\r\nequalized matters, but the preponderance of Guatemalans in the legislature\r\nremained a problem in the view of the more provincial areas.\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/unitedprovincesofcentralamericamap-green.png">\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;\r\nBoundaries between states were redrawn, and in some instances the\r\nchanges were peacefully accomplished. Guatemala gave Sonsonate, part\r\nof its fertile Pacific coast, to El Salvador, and contemplated carving a\r\nsixth state called Los Altos out of its western highlands (SEE map below).\r\nLos Altos would have had Quetzaltenango, the second largest\r\ntown in Guatemala, as its capital, and thus a population of more than\r\n200,000, greater than any state other than Guatemala. The final decision\r\nto create Los Altos, however, was delayed from fear this Quiché\r\nregion might secede (which it did anyway, but only for a brief period,\r\n1838 to 1839). Costa Rica officially separated from Nicaragua and\r\nannexed Nicaragua’s region of Guanacaste, including the Nicoya\r\nPeninsula. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="another page"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/cararcedelvalle.jpg" style="width:100%;"><br>\r\n\r\nOther state borders, however, were disputed well into the\r\n20th century, especially in the areas of British interests, such as the\r\nMosquitía and Belize. Part of the problem was not simply territorial, but\r\nalso ignorance about the geography of the isthmus. Although demarcations\r\nbetween the member states were not all resolved and the imbalances\r\nwere barely corrected, the federation proved that important\r\ncompromises could be made, just as they were in the drafting of the\r\nconstitution.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nWhile the constitutional assembly was attempting to shape the future of\r\nCentral America, more provincial interests continued to fester. Except in\r\nCosta Rica, long-held antagonisms between elite families and neighboring\r\ntownships rose to the surface and the contenders vied with one\r\nanother for power under the new government. Comayagua, the capital,\r\nand Tegucigalpa, the bustling economic center, fought for control of\r\nHonduras; the fighting did not cease until they agreed to alternate the\r\ncapital between them every other year. León, a liberal Nicaraguan city\r\nand home to the second university in Central America, bitterly fought\r\nGranada, the aristocratic economic stronghold. In Guatemala, the\r\nexpanding center of the western highlands, the conservative interests in\r\nQuetzaltenango undermined liberal ones in Guatemala City. Everywhere\r\nturf battles as old as the early struggles among conquistadores were\r\nfueled by the lack of an established central authority.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe weakness of the national government was starkly revealed in\r\nNicaragua when war broke out between León and Granada, a conflict\r\nthat would not truly be resolved until a neutral capital was created at\r\nManagua in 1857. The federal government wished to send a negotiator,\r\nbut El Salvador wanted to send in its own troops in clear defiance of the\r\nconstitution. El Salvador acted unilaterally and, unfortunately for the\r\nfederal government, successfully brought about a temporary peace in\r\nJanuary 1825.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nTaxation, too, was an ongoing problem. The national congress would\r\nnot grant the government enough authority to function without fiscal\r\nreliance on the states. The tobacco monopoly, for example, was given to\r\neach province to administer on the condition that a percentage of the\r\nrevenues would be paid to the federal government; most states\r\nneglected to comply. Deeply suspicious of the central authority, the\r\nstates seemed willing to bankrupt it. And it became transparently clear\r\nthat most congressional deputies held the narrow interests of their\r\nhome states, not those of the republic, dear.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe congress also maneuvered to control the first presidential election.\r\nBy promoting numerous candidates, it hoped to take a majority away\r\nfrom the certain victory for statesman José del Valle, <i>pictured right</i>. With the election\r\nthen given to congress to resolve, the conservative deputies planned to\r\nchoose the candidate they could most easily control. Valle won a popular\r\nmajority nonetheless, but the congress disqualified the vote on a questionable\r\ntechnicality. The congressional choice was Manuel José Arce, <i>pictured left</i>, a\r\nsupposed liberal from El Salvador, who garnered more votes from the\r\nconservatives than did their conservative colleague Valle. The first election\r\nof the United Provinces of Central America defied the popular will,\r\nand the first president of Central America was compromised before he\r\nwas even sworn into office. The republic was in the hands of the deputies\r\nand local interests, and the federation was beginning to look more like a\r\nloose confederation of small independent nations than a single republic.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n	1823	1823	6	48	A BRIEF HISTORY OF CENTRAL AMERICA, LYNN V.

391	Costa Rica's Changing Economy	<p class="entry columns">\r\nCosta Rica's external debt tripled from 1977 to 1981, and has since almost doubled to over $4 billion, with new loans of $500 million in 1988 and a trade deficit of $200 million a year. Current debt to private banks amounts to $200 million in interest alone, but though payment is largely suspended, the international lending institutions keep the funds flowing. &quot;Costa Rica has lost the ability to determine its own economic future,&quot; the San Jose journal Mesoamerica concluded in mid-1988, reporting that real wages had fallen 42 percent in the preceding five years, as prices increased while subsidies for food and medicine were reduced or eliminated. The infant mortality rate had risen sharply in certain areas, primarily because of the economic crisis and increasing hunger, according to the University of Costa Rica's Institute for Health Research. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) demanded further cuts in social spending, lowering of the minimum wage, and cutting of government employees, &quot;thus jeopardizing what had been one of the most enlightened social service programs in Latin America,&quot; Mesoamerica reports. Once self-sufficient in agriculture, Costa Rica is now importing staples as it shifts to largely foreign-controlled exports, including export crops, in line with traditional IMF-World Bank-USAID directives, a familiar recipe for disaster in Third World countries. &quot;Arias's pro-big business economic strategy,&quot; COHA observes, may turn large numbers of once self-sufficient farmers to wage laborers on agribusiness plantations while profits are largely expatriated, &quot;a major change of philosophy in a country that has had a strong state-directed welfare orientation.&quot;</p>	1977	1981	5	31	Necessary Illusions, Chomsky	large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:50.497415	2015-02-13 04:07:50.497415	\N

Whatever equipment they didn't understand, they ruined. For example, when they found the computer machinery, they tossed bombs and destroyed all of the university's records. In the agronomic science department, they discovered infrared equipment. The officers told their troops that the students used these ‘torture rooms' against policemen and the army, so they destroyed them. Medical equipment and most of the medical library were also destroyed. The humanities building was burned to the ground. Some 30 faculty members were murdered or disappeared, according to the new rector.</p>	1980	1980	9	76		medium	f	2015-02-13 04:07:50.589342	2015-02-13 04:07:50.589342	\N

404	Ramping up the Embargo 1980-present 	<img src="/mapimages/reaganbushclintontableau.jpg" style="height:106px;width:100%;">\r\n<p class="entry columns3" >After several years of a warming relationship, Reagan re-tightens the embargo. \r\n<br>\r\nIn 1982, Reagan removed a 1977 fishing treaty and re-instituted the travel restrictions that Carter had let lapse as a symbolic gesture of renewed relations, symbolizing another new era of sanctions. In 1986, Reagan dismantled the allowance of imported small gifts an remittances to Cuban relatives. In 1988, Reagan put up restrictions on subsidiaries making shipments to and from Cuba, which had been mainly through third party countries.\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout Reagan's term, the US Treasury was ordered to crack down on previously overlooked aspects of the embargo, including examining what special visa holders were doing in Cuba. Of particular interest were journalists, scholars, and lawyers. Numerous cases and lawsuits were filed to send the message that Cuban relations and trading were going to be strictly monitored.\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 further restricted trade: Third party nations and foreign US-owned or operated subsidiaries were again forbidden from trading with Cuba, boats belonging to third party nations were disallowed from docking in the United States for 180 days after trading with Cuba, and the treasury department got the right to prosecute any violators, with fines of $1M for corporations, and $100K for civilians. It also  reinstated the denial of American aid to countries that provided assistance to Cuba.\r\n<br>\r\nThe CDA was met with a resounding disdain in the international community, leading to a UN resolution directed at the United States expressing a deep concern for the US extraterritorial legislation. The list of countries opposed to the CDA included Canada, Britain, France, Japan, Spain, Mexico, and Brazil. Despite its overwhelming unpopularity, the CDA was not be revoked.\r\n<br> \r\nFollowing the election of Bill Clinton, small reforms were passed, but nothing that really affected the overall policy. It wasn't until the passage of the Helms-Burton Act in March of 1996 that a big change was initiated in the Cuban sanctions. The act included the following:\r\n<br>• International Sanctions against the Castro Government. Economic embargo, any non-US company dealing economically with Cuba can be subjected to legal action and that company's leadership can be barred from entry into the United States. Sanctions may be applied to non-U.S. companies trading with Cuba. This means that internationally operating companies have to choose between Cuba and the US, which is a much larger market.\r\n<br>• United States opposition against Cuban membership in international financial institutions.\r\n<br>• Television broadcasting from the United States to Cuba.\r\n<br>• Authorization of United States support for democratic and human rights groups and international observers.\r\n<br>• U.S. policy towards a transition government and a democratically elected government in Cuba. (Sanctions to be lifted when these things occur)\r\n<br>• Protection of property rights of certain United States nationals.\r\n<br>• Exclusion of certain aliens from the United States, primarily senior officials or major stock holders, and their families, of companies that do business in Cuba on property expropriated from American citizens. To date, executives from Italy, Mexico, Canada, Israel, and the United Kingdom have been barred.\r\n<br>• Legislative Branch granted power to override an Executive Branch cancellation of the embargo.\r\n<br>• Prohibits recognition of a transitional government in Cuba that includes Fidel or Raul Castro\r\n<br>• Prohibits recognition of a Cuban government that has not provided compensation for U.S. certified claims against confiscated property, defined as non-residential property with an excess of $50,000 value in 1959.\r\n<br>\r\nThe US continues to fund terrorist and anti-Cuban organizations today. </p>	1980	2020	5	32		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:50.639781	2015-02-13 04:07:50.639781	\N

407	The Assassination of Archbishop Romero	<p class="entry columns">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/romero-martyred.jpg" style="float:right; margin:0px 7px;">\r\n<br>\r\nIn March, Archbishop Romero was assassinated while celebrating Mass. A judicial investigation was initiated, headed by Judge Atilio Ramirez. He accused General Medrano, the death squad organizer and US favorite, and rightwing leader Roberto d'Aubuisson of hiring the assassins, and shortly after, fled the country after death threats and an attempt on his life. In exile, Judge Ramirez reports that the Criminal Investigation Section of the National Police did not arrive until four days after the assassination and "did not provide the Court any data or evidence of an investigation into the crime." The same was true of the Office of the Attorney General. Judge Ramirez concludes that "it is undoubtedly the case that from the very beginning, they were involved in a kind of conspiracy to cover up the murder." The security forces were not entirely inactive, however. They did raid the Legal Aid Office of the Archbishopric, removing all files bearing on the assassination, including testimony implicating the military. None of this evidence has surfaced, and neither the US government nor the press seems much interested. The Director of the Church Legal Aid Office also fled the country after death threats and warnings that his children and wife would be killed. The offices were repeatedly raided by security forces, and human rights leaders have been harassed and murdered, also with little notice in the press here, apart from reiteration of government lies that they were "guerrillas."\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p class="caption" style="text-align:left;">Moments after he is shot, frantic worshipers tend to their fallen priest, Archbishop Romero.</p>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\nAn excerpt of Archbishop Romero's last Sermon: <br>"<i>I would like to make a special appeal to the men of the army, and specifically to the ranks of the National Guard, the police and the military. Brothers, you come from our own people. You are killing your own brother peasants when any human order to kill must be subordinate to the law of God which says, "Thou shalt not kill." No soldier is obliged to obey an order contrary to the law of God. No one has to obey an immoral law. It is high time you recovered your consciences and obeyed your consciences rather than a sinful order. The church, the defender of the rights of God, of the law of God, of human dignity, of the person, cannot remain silent before such an abomination. We want the government to face the fact that reforms are valueless if they are to be carried out at the cost of so much blood. In the name of God, in the name of this suffering people whose cries rise to heaven more loudly each day, I implore you, I beg you, I order you in the name of God: stop the repression.\r\n<br>\r\nThe church preaches your liberation just as we have studied it in just as we have studied it in the holy Bible today. It is a liberation that has, above all else, respect for the dignity of the person, hope for humanity's common good, and the transcendence that looks before all to God and only from God derives its hope and its strength.</i>"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n	1980	1980	10	80	Turning the Tide, Noam Chomsky	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:50.658422	2015-02-13 04:07:50.658422	\N

543	The first major peasant rebellion in El Salvador occurs.	<strong>1833</strong> <i> The first major peasant rebellion in El Salvador occurs. It is led by the Indian Anastasio Aquino.</i>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/anastasioaquino.jpg" style="float:left;height:160px;width:126px;padding: 0px 7px;">\r\nThe conversion of El Salvador into an oligarchic state and an agro-export\r\neconomy based on private property was by no means a smooth\r\nprocess. It depended as much upon the exercise of class and ethnic violence\r\nas it did upon the entrepreneurial zeal and political confidence so celebrated\r\nin the opening years of the new century. Indeed, it was in El\r\nSalvador that Liberalism had first been challenged by Indian resistance in\r\nthe aftermath of Central American independence; in 1833 the popular\r\nuprising led by Anastasio Aquino had required the deployment of troops\r\nfrom outside the province and wide-spread repression before social order\r\nwas restored and the ladino state secured.\r\n<br>\r\nThe Anastasio Aquino revolt of 1833 signified\r\none of the great contradictions of independence in Latin America in general.\r\nIndependence from Spain did not equal Indian independence simply by\r\nvirtue of the action itself. Oppression against Indians now possessed another\r\nelement: the lack of church protection. Whereas one of the only avenues of\r\nprotection for the Indians used to be the Crown, and with the Spanish Crown\r\ngone, the Indian population became subject to further losses in land and life\r\nby the new independence leadership and those that followed. The nationalist\r\nleadership sought to exploit as much land as possible and therefore moved to\r\nprivatize large tracts of land that had been under the protection of the Crown\r\nfor the purposes of continued indigenous usage.\r\n<br>\r\nLabor conditions also became worse under the new leaders, and this more\r\nthan likely provoked the Aquino uprising. Anastasio Aquino and his brother\r\nBlas were indigo workers on a hacienda when Blas was punished via the\r\nstocks. It was well understood that forced labor of Indians was commonly\r\npracticed and this occurred not only on the indigo haciendas but in the regular\r\nSalvadoran army as well. When Indian troops were used to put down a\r\nladino uprising against the government in October of 1832, and ladino-Indian\r\nclashes erupted in San Miguel in January 1833 with massive suppression of\r\nthe Indians by the government, Aquino and his followers decided to rise up\r\nfrom Santiago Nonualco. Aquino’s guerrillas were particularly offended by\r\nforced conscription of Indians fighting for the elite’s cause and their initial\r\nattacks concentrated on liberating the Indian conscripts and their weapons in\r\norder to build a base for a continued battle against the state. Aquino decreed a ban on collecting taxes and debts, all with very severe penalties. He also banned the making and consumption of liquor, a means for sedation and degradation against the large masses in the countryside.\r\n<br>\r\nThe first major battles against government forces were successful and signaled\r\nthe possibility that Aquino’s men might take the capital if they so chose.\r\nHowever, they decided to conquer lesser towns such as San Vicente and Zacatecoluca,\r\nthus giving the military a window of time and space to recover.\r\nWhen marched into San Vicente, he seized a crown from the head of a \r\nstatue of Saint Joseph and placed it on his own head.\r\n Although Aquino took San Vicente twice in February, his movement was quickly\r\nput down at the end of that month, and he was executed in July.\r\n<br>\r\nAquino soon becomes a martyr for the disenfranchised much like the rest of the\r\nheroes of El Salvador’s poor throughout postindependence history. After his\r\nexecution, his severed head was placed in a cage and put on display as a message\r\nto all other potential rebels.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\nFrom Eduardo Galeano's <i>Faces and Masks</i>:\r\n<br><i>The head of Aquino lies in the executioner's basket. \r\n<br>May he rest in war. The chief of the Indians in El Salvador had raised three thousand spears against the robbers of the lands. He got the better of the muskets, which the enemy fired with glowing cigars, and stripped Saint Joseph naked on the high altar of a church. Clad in the cloak of the father of Christ, he proclaimed that Indians would never again be slaves, nor soldiers, nor famished, nor drunk. But more troops arrived, and he had to seek refuge in the mountains.<br>\r\nHis lieutenant, named Cascabel, turned him in.<br>\r\n"Now I am a jaguar without claws or Fangs," said Aquino, when they loaded him with shackles and chains; and he confessed to Fray Navarro that in all his life he had only been frightened by the anger or tears of his wife.\r\n</i><br>\r\n</p>	1833	1833	7	40	THE HISTORY OF EL SALVADOR by Christopher M.

Carter, because it was a matter\r\nof faith, made human rights a leitmotif of his foreign policy.\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/anastasiosomoza.jpg" style="padding:7px 7px 7px 0px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;"><br>\r\n<span class="caption">Anastasio (&quot;Tachito&quot;) Somoza</span>\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nSomoza was confused by Carter's apparent sincerity on the human\r\nrights issue. His family had been installed in power by President Franklin\r\nRoosevelt, the man who also had made human rights the center piece\r\nof US policy in his Four Freedoms address during World War II. But\r\nRoosevelt had never bothered the Somoza clan with complaints about\r\nhuman rights violations. After all, forty-five years of anti-communist\r\nobedience should have counted for more than a few cases of maltreating\r\nradical trouble makers.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nWhen Somoza finally realized that Carter was serious, he found\r\nhimself in an impossible position. To lift martial law for the purpose of\r\ncontinuing to receive US aid and legitimation would also mean allowing\r\nthe FSLN to have the necessary space to organize throughout the\r\ncountry. To abide by Carter's principles would require Somoza to leash\r\nand muzzle the National Guard; to remove from it the very instruments\r\nby which it had succeeded in terrorizing the population.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nSomoza paid lip service to human rights, hoping that it would appease\r\nthe US ambassador, while at the same time he ordered the Guard to\r\nwipe out Sandinista influence in me poor barrios and the Christian\r\nbased communities where the priests and nuns were applying their\r\nrevolutionary theology. However, the ambassador did not turn the other\r\nway in 1977 and 1978 as Guard members murdered, tortured, raped\r\nand looted their way through the barrios and rural areas. US officials\r\ndenounced the abuses, threatened to cut off aid, and eventually did so\r\nin 1978. Subsequently writing from exile in Paraguay in the 1980s,\r\nSomoza charged: 'Our nation was truly delivered into the hands of the\r\nMarxist enemy by President Jimmy Carter and his administration. I was\r\nbetrayed by a longstanding and trusted ally.' Somoza had a point. Having\r\nlabeled the FSLN communists, and received encouragement and support\r\nfrom right-wing friends in the US military and in Congress for forty\r\nyears, Somoza could not believe that the United States would allow the\r\n'communists' to triumph.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nBut Carter believed he had a mandate to restore US credibility after\r\nthe stains left by the Vietnam War and the revelations of CIA\r\nshenanigans - including its support for corrupt and brutal dictators.\r\nThe era of world politics had passed when American presidents could\r\nwith impunity maintain the Somozas of the Third World as reliable\r\nclients.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="UNITY"></div>\r\n\r\n<table style="margin-top:15px;"><tr><Td width=280 valign=top><img src="/mapimages/nicaragua1978somoza.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">\r\n<span class="caption">Somoza Enters the National Assembly for the Last Time in 1978</span><br><br><br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/nicaragua1978bayareasolidarity.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">\r\n<br>\r\n<span class="caption">Bay Area solidarity Activists in 1978</span>\r\n</td><Td><p class="entry columns2" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-top: -1px;">Since Somoza had no desire to transform himself and his Praetorian\r\nGuard into anything that could conceivably qualify as democracy, he\r\nchose more repression. He thought that by increasing the level of\r\nbrutality the Guard could cow the populace back into obedience. He\r\nwas wrong. The more brutal the Guard's behavior, the more resistant\r\nthe populace grew. As Guard units marched through the barrios, or\r\nrandomly shot poor teenagers and middle-class youth, fear turned to\r\noutrage. People who for decades had accepted the savageries of the\r\nGuard could tolerate no more.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Inside Nicaragua and in the United States, the anti-Somoza forces\r\ncoalesced. Illiterate peasants and local merchants in Nicaragua found\r\nthemselves allied in the struggle against Somoza with exiled dish\r\nwashers in Houston and University of California students. Some became\r\nguerrillas, while others served as lobbyists, pamphleteers, or fund raisers\r\nin Washington. A group of well known professionals and business\r\nexecutives formed 'Los Doce', a group of twelve reasonable and\r\nresponsible moderates who appealed to middle-class opinion throughout\r\nthe world to join in with money and moral support to oust the dictator\r\nand his hated Guard.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;In January 1978, an event occurred that galvanized the fragmented\r\nanti-Somoza opposition. Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, the dynamic editor\r\nof <i>La Prensa</i>, Managua's leading daily, was assassinated. The popular\r\nChamorro had openly published demands for Somoza's removal, and\r\ncalled for broad national unity. Although lacking direct proof, most\r\nNicaraguans assumed Tachito had ordered the slaying. Chamorro, hardly\r\na leftist, had criticized the FSLN 's radical rhetoric, but the Sandinistas,\r\nnevertheless, joined other anti-Somoza elements, including labor unions,\r\nin organizing mass protests, strikes and demonstrations in response to\r\nChamorro's murder. By mid-1978 the Church had added its weight to\r\nthe growing demand that Somoza resign.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;The US government was in the throes of a decisive policy debate.\r\nPresident Carter faced a choice: Somoza, a flagrant rights violator; or\r\nthe FSLN, regarded in intelligence and diplomatic circles as communists,\r\nor, at best, independent leftists friendly to Castro.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;'Another Cuba' in Central America was deemed unacceptable, but\r\nthe continuation of Somoza rule appeared dubious. National Security\r\nAdviser, Zbigniew Brzinski, feared that by applying human rights criteria\r\nto Nicaragua, the United States would strengthen the revolutionaries.\r\nSince the Guard was loyal to Somoza, not the Nicaraguan Constitution,\r\nTachito's removal would lead to its disintegration, Brzinksi believed.\r\nThe only armed force then remaining would be the FSLN. The human\r\nrights activists inside the administration downplayed the Sandinista\r\nthreat and emphasized to the president the importance of maintaining\r\nconsistency on human rights. Carter compromised between the competing ideological wings of his administration.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p></td></tr></table>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="WAR"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="height:580px;font-size: 1.1em;">\r\n&emsp;Reversing nearly a century of tradition, President Carter asked Somoza\r\nto step down as a way of ending the civil war, while retaining intact the\r\nNational Guard, whose loyalties should logically rum from Somoza to\r\nits next benefactor, the United States. It was not an act of idealism, but\r\nrather a realistic judgment on the part of the president. US intelligence\r\nreports agreed that the tide had turned in Nicaragua and that the\r\ndictator's days were numbered. But Carter's decision came too late for\r\nthe national security apparatus to save the Guard. The action on the\r\nbattlefields had ensured the Sandinistas their rightful place as heads of\r\nState.<br>&emsp;\r\nThe battlefield included the very center of government in Managua.\r\nOn 23 August 1978, eleven months before Somoza fled and the Guard\r\ncollapsed, Sandinista soldiers dressed in Guard uniforms arrived in army\r\ntrucks at both entrances of the National Palace, where Somoza's\r\nlegislature convened. Using their best imitation of Guard officer speech,\r\nthey deceived the troops stationed at the doors and other posts. Once\r\ninside, the Sandinistas held captive Somoza's friends, allies and even\r\nfamily members. For Tachito it was supremely humiliating.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nA demoralized Somoza yielded to the Sandinistas' demands for the\r\nrelease of the Nicaraguan glitterati: $500,000 in exchange for safe\r\nconduct from the palace to the airport, where the captors would be\r\nflown to Cuba, plus the release of fifty-nine political prisoners. Even\r\nNational Guard officers winced when Somoza caved in. Morale sank\r\nfor a short time.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nTo revive the fighting spirit of his men, Somoza ordered unprecedentedly\r\nvicious levels of reprisals against the revolutionaries. Inspired\r\nby their palace victory, the Sandinistas called for uprisings. In Matagalpa.\r\naccording to the Nicaraguan press, 'armed youths in rebellion' took\r\nover thirty city blocks. The Guard responded with artillery, armored\r\nvehicles and heavy machine-gun fire to retake the neighborhood. On\r\nAugust 27, the Catholic Church called upon Somoza to resign as 'the\r\nonly way to end the current political violence'.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn the final days of August the depressed Tachito regained the\r\nruthlessness that had made him the scourge of the nation. He purged\r\nGuard officers who had criticized his weakness in bargaining with the\r\nrebels. Charged and found guilty of conspiring to overthrow the\r\ngovernment were eighty-five Guardsmen, including twelve officers. As\r\nfor the 'communists and subversives', his name for all revolutionaries,\r\nSomoza told his generals to show no mercy. Sandinisus or suspected\r\nsympathizers were rounded up, tortured, interrogated and then killed.\r\nThe Guard carried out fishing expeditions in the barrios, targeting\r\nespecially the youth. Thousands of men and women were arrested and\r\nshot simply because they were young. Instead of submitting, the public\r\nwere spurred to uncontainable rage.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="MUCHACHOS"></div>\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/nicaragua1979resistance.jpg" style="padding:7px;column-span: all;width:99%;">\r\n<p class="entry" style="height:350px">\r\n&emsp;While the human rights advocates and the national security hawks\r\ndebated policy in Washington, the Guard's ferocity claimed the attention\r\nof the world's media. And the Sandinistas, feeling the public pulse,\r\nstruck. On 7 September 1978 guerrilla units descended from the\r\nmountains to launch a major offensive, attacking and holding parts of\r\nfive major cities. Several thousand Sandinistas took part in the offensive,\r\nsending the Guard reeling.

They fought with weapons\r\nstolen from the Guard, sticks, stones and home-crafted Molotov cocktails. Faced with the wrath of the people, the Guard did not flee, but counterattacked with artillery and aeria1 bombing. When the smoke\r\nfinally cleared and the Guard regained control, the bodies of young\r\nboys and girls were strewn across the makeshift barricades and trenches.\r\nCommercial and residential areas, schools and churches, looked like\r\nCoventry after days of Axis bombing during World War II. Those\r\nedifices that remained structurally in tact bore the scars of bullets and\r\nshells.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;The neighborhood of Monimbo, in the city of Masaya, rose up and\r\nwith home-made weapons and rocks held off the heavily armed troops,\r\nthen suffered the retaliation. 'We fought against the Guard to save our\r\nlives,' recalled Ernesto Rodriguez Zelaya, a Monimbo mechanic. 'We\r\nrealized that after the [Guard's} &quot;mopping up&quot; operation life wasn't\r\nworth anything. Whoever stayed home would be killed! It was easier\r\nfor us to grab a rifle and fight with the muchachos than stay home where\r\nwe would be just a target for the Guard. So it was the repression that\r\nmade us fight, because we didn't want to die.'\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn February 1978, Monimbo residents rose again, fought with unbelievable\r\ncourage, using paving stones from Somoza's own factory as\r\nweapons, and then faced the renewed vengeance of the Guard.\r\nBut even after the continued bombing and shelling of the area, the\r\nMonimbo dwellers refused to submit. The Guard could not regain\r\ncontrol.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe behavior of the Monimbo populace dramatized a larger reality,\r\none that even jaded members of US intelligence could not escape: the\r\nvast majority of Nicaraguans were prepared to endure immense pain\r\nand suffering to rid themselves of the Somoza family and their Guard.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nTachito understood the people's loathing and responded accordingly.\r\nHe ordered his air force to bomb and strafe guerrilla-held cities. Even\r\nafter the FSLN had retreated, the air force continued to bomb, to\r\nensure that the populace would get the message. When the bodies were\r\ncounted, the Red Cross announced that over five thousand had perished\r\nfrom Esteli, Masaya and Leon alone. A further 10,000 were missing;\r\n15,000 were wounded; 30,000 were homeless.

On June 9 the National Guard\r\nbegan intensive bombing and strafing of Monimbo, 'the pissed off\r\nbarrio', as it became known. Following the bombing, a column of\r\nSherman tanks led Guard foot soldiers through the Sandinista controlled\r\nneighborhoods to retake portions of Masaya.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe guerrillas beat a strategic retreat, but returned unexpectedly three\r\ndays later and retook most of the city. For two weeks the battle raged,\r\nblock by block. 'The Guard didn't push us out: a Sandinista officer\r\nreported, 'because they didn't receive reinforcements, nor did we take\r\nthem out since we didn't have any ammunition.'\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOn June 24 Guard officers and men abandoned their Masaya\r\ncommand post, using hundreds of political prisoners as a shield to cover\r\ntheir retreat. The Sandinistas were in undisputed control of the city,\r\ntwenty miles south of Managua. Somoza spent his days in the bunker,\r\nbuilt on top of a Managua hill overlooking the Intercontinental Hotel.\r\nOne June evening he met members of the media in an 'off the record'\r\nsession. One reporter, nevertheless, recorded the conversation. Why\r\nwas he bombing his own people, destroying Nicaraguan property, he\r\nwas asked. 'What do you know about underdevelopment?' he slurred,\r\nshowing the effects of a day of drinking. 'My people are a bunch of\r\nlazy, stupid, underdeveloped assholes.'\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn late June, Tachito ordered his bombers to drop 500 pounders on\r\ndensely populated Managua neighborhoods. The Sandinistas, who had\r\ntaken the poor barrios from the Guard, immediately retreated to Masaya,\r\nbut the muchachos who survived the bombings continued to snipe at and\r\nambush the Guard in the capital. The US ambassador demanded that\r\nSomoza resign, hoping that it was still not too late to save the Guard\r\nexcept for its most notorious officers. Apart from unwavering support\r\nfrom the Israeli government - of which Somoza had been a loyal supporter - and a few cohorts among the remaining Latin American dictators, Tachito was isolated.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="POWER"></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/fslnflag.jpg" style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0; max-width: 1020px; clip: rect(0px,1020px,660px,0px);z-index:-1;">\r\n<p class="entry">\r\n<table>\r\n<tr><td bgcolor="white" width="330" valign="top" style="padding:9px;">\r\n\r\n&emsp;\r\nHe knew the war was over, but nevertheless ordered his air force to\r\ncontinue bombing. His family had stolen hundreds of millions of dollars\r\nfrom the Nicaraguan people, and Tachito expressed his attitude toward\r\nhis victims as if to make a final statement that would etch into\r\nNicaraguan memory the essence of the cruelty that had characterized\r\nthe forty-five years of Somoza clan rule.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOn July 17 the Somoza family fled to Miami, Florida. Without\r\nSomoza's presence, there was nothing to hold the Guard together.\r\nOverwhelmed and demoralized, the once invincible National Guard\r\ncollapsed. Some units surrendered to FSLN commanders, others fled\r\nas one or in ragtag fashion to borders north and south. On July 19 the\r\nSandinistas held state power.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe Nicaragua Revolution triumphed, like the Cuban one twenty\r\nyears earlier, not just because of the Sandinistas' astute military strategy\r\nand tactics employed, or the mistakes of the National Guard. A peculiar\r\nconjuncture of events and times also created a setting on which the\r\ndecisive battles were fought. In Washington, the human rights element\r\nin the administration temporarily obstructed national security interventionists;\r\nCosta Rica provided unusual levels of help for the Sandinistas,\r\nthanks to Somoza's 'bad\r\n</td>\r\n<td width="400"></td>\r\n\r\n<td bgcolor="white" cellpadding="9" width="360" valign="top" style="padding:9px;">\r\n neighbor' policy toward the Sandinistas,\r\nthanks to Somoza's 'bad neighbor' policy toward the San Jose\r\nregime; in Cuba, a Solomon-like Fidel Castro persuaded the rival factions\r\nof the FSLN to bury their ideological differences and unify.<br>\r\n&emsp;\r\nThe revolution could not have triumphed without the ambivalence\r\nof President Carter, just as its subsequent programs could not be realized\r\nwithout a similar kind of vacillation from the Reagan administration.\r\nThe Sandinistas captured world opinion, an intangible factor that\r\nnevertheless wove its way through White House thinking and mass\r\nmedia concepts and images. Somoza had made fundamental errors in\r\njudgment. His tactics had alienated even the wealthy, who had for\r\ndecades accepted the caprices of his family rule.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe Somozas had accumulated more than 5500 million during their\r\ndynastic rule. They possessed one fifth of Nicaragua's arable land and\r\nmore than one hundred and fifty businesses. In addition, the family had\r\naccounts and assets in the United States and Europe that were believed\r\nto be more than double what they owned in Nicaragua. Somoza believed\r\nthat as long as the United States was interested in maintaining its\r\nhegemony, the US government would protect him. Tachito's contempt\r\nfor his own countrymen and women was so great that it did not occur to him that Nicaraguans could play a role in determining the fate of\r\ntheir nation.</p>\r\n</td></tr></table>	1978	1978	1	98	THE GUERRILLA WARS OF CENTRAL AMERICA, Saul Landau 	large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:50.697641	2015-02-13 04:07:50.697641	\N

416	Denunciation	<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:1.05em;">Adolfo Perez Esquivel of the Service of Peace and Justice, who denounces the massive violations of human rights, receives the Nobel Peace Prize.\r\n<br>\r\nIn his acceptance speech, he speaks <span style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;<i>of Latin America where we experience constant violations of the human rights of the people. The violence is expressed toward the disappeared, the prisoners, the tortured, the exiles, the lack of freedom of the press, etc. ... it is not only with the attacks against the rights of persons that we must deal. We must analyze also, in all the dimensions of this reality, the deep structural causes which generate these conflict situations. For that, the struggle for the dignity of the individual must consider society as much as the individual in all which has to do with the development of the rights of the people.\r\n<br>\r\n&quot;But this same continent and these same human beings live, besides, in the hope of making their own history. And to this immense task, where I humbly include myself, we take no more than our own hands and great faith.\r\n<br>\r\n&quot;To those of you also involved in this struggle on behalf of the poor, I want to bring you the image of this deeply absorbing situation and its significance for world peace.\r\n<br>\r\n&quot;Latin America does not see itself in the same way, but finds itself caught between an economic-political system and an international social system in profound transformation. Its image of violence reflects the violence of our contemporary world. Its injustices are bound up within an unjust international system, a system whose mechanisms, in the words of John Paul II, 'are mechanisms encountered impregnated not with an authentic humanism, but with materialism producing an international standard with the rich ever richer at the expense of the poor ever poorer'.\r\n<br>\r\n&quot;It is necessary to create the conditions that permit displacing the mechanisms which secure the domination of one country over another. I want to affirm, together with our Latin American pastors in the meeting at Puebla, that in the ability to live together, '... all human beings hold the common good as fundamental, consistent with the ever more fraternal realization of common dignity which does not use some persons as tools for the benefit of others, and that all be disposed to sacrifice for some particular good ends'. This common dignity necessarily implies the existence of liberty.\r\n<br>\r\n&quot;And for us liberty is that inalienable capacity that all humans alike have at their disposal.\r\n<br>\r\n&quot;This is the capacity that permits the building of communion and participation which encourage human beings to relate fully with the world, with their brothers and sisters and with God.\r\n<br>\r\n&quot;I see with concern that this new international system, marked as it is by the existence of great multinational corporations, is far from increasing participation and improving channels of expression for the majority. What is essential are new constructs that allow political participation, eliminating the distance between the governors and the governed, that support the privileges of minorities, and do not hold on to the old, the known and worn-out structures of injustice.&quot;</i></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	1980	1980	9	3	Horacio Verbitsky's Confessions of an Argentine Dirty Warrior	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:50.742186	2015-02-13 04:07:50.742186	\N

428	To Persuade	<p class="entry columns">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/meisalasbigpine.jpg" class="floatright">\r\n\r\nDuring the early 1980s, conflict in Central America increased Honduras's strategic importance and led the United States government to maintain a significant military presence in Central America as a counterforce against the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. Sharp increases in military assistance to Honduras followed the buildup of United States troops and equipment in Honduras. In 1983 United States forces began a series of large- scale maneuvers in Honduras that not only provided joint training for United States and Honduran forces but also allowed the administration of Ronald W. Reagan to skirt congressional limits on military aid to that country and the Contras. Throughout the 1980s, the United States also built or improved military-related installations such as airfield, barracks, and radar stations. \r\n<br>\r\nIn February 1983, the United States and Honduras conducted a joint military exercise called Big Pine, which was the largest of its kind ever held in Honduras. A total of 1,600 United States military personnel and 4,000 Honduran soldiers participated in exercises designed to help Honduras improve its deployment techniques and logistical support in the field. United States Army elements provided mobility for Honduran forces and logistics and communications assistance. United States Navy elements included two landing ships and two landing craft. United States Air Force personnel participated in the coordination of landing and air supply operations. A number of training personnel, mostly from the United States Army, remained in the country to train the Honduran army in infantry tactics. Also during the exercises, a sizable radar installation staffed by over fifty United States Air Force technicians was placed south of Tegucigalpa. \r\n<br>\r\nThe number of United States advisers increased further in mid-1983 when the United States and Honduras approved a new training agreement as an amendment to the 1954 military assistance agreement. The two countries constructed a military training facility, near Puerto Castilla on the Caribbean coast, at a cost of some US$250,000. The primary purpose of this facility, called the Regional Center for Military Training (Centro Regional de Entrenamiento Militar—CREM), was to train Salvadoran ground forces, although Hondurans also received training. The center initially had about 125 United States Army Special Forces personnel, raising the total number of trainers in the country to approximately 270 in July 1983. \r\n<br>\r\nAlthough CREM closed in 1985, United States military advisers remained. Between 1983 and 1993, the United States and Honduras have carried out an almost continuous string of joint military maneuvers on Honduran soil. To facilitate the maneuvers and strengthen Honduras's military infrastructure, the Honduran government has built a network of roads, improved ports, and constructed additional airfields. \r\n<br>\r\nBetween August 1983 and February 1984, United States forces carried out Big Pine II, a considerably more extensive military exercise than the earlier Big Pine maneuvers, involving up to 5,000 United States military personnel. Extensive naval maneuvers involved two United States Navy aircraft carrier task forces, another task force led by the battleship U.S.S. New Jersey, and a landing by the United States Marines on the Caribbean coast during portions of the exercises. The purpose, according to a senior United States official, was to demonstrate the ability of United States military forces to operate in Central America and to persuade the Sandinista government of Nicaragua to desist from fomenting insurrection in the region. </p>\r\n\r\n<i>Photo: Puerto Castilla. 1983.

That was then the beginning of this war that Reagan invented and mounted and financed and directed: the Contra War. About which he continually lied to the people, helping the United States people to be the most ignorant people around the world. I said ignorant, I don't say not intelligent. But the most ignorant people around the world about what the United States does abroad. <font style="color:#cc0000">People don't even begin to see — if they did, they would rebel.</font>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, he lied to the people, as [George W.] Bush lies to the people today and as they push on, thinking that the United States is above every law, human or divine. And we took the United States, Reagan's United States, his government to court, the World Court. I was Foreign Minister at that time here in Nicaragua. I was responsible for that. And the United States government received the harshest sentence, the harshest condemnation ever in the history of world justice. In spite of the fact that the United States since the early 1920's has been proclaiming to the world that one of the proofs of its moral superiority as compared to other countries around the world is the fact that it abides by the international law and was obedient to the world court when the United States was brought to the world court in Nicaragua and received the condemnation that the United States failed to heed the sentence and they still owe Nicaragua; by now, [it] must be between 20,000 and $30,000 million. At the time when we left government that the damages caused by that Reagan war was over $17 billion, and this, according to very moderate estimators of damage, people from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, people from Harvard University and from Oxford and from the University of Paris basically this is the team that was pulled together to estimate the damage. \r\n<br>\r\nThe United States was ordered to pay for the damage. Bush never even wanted to talk to me about it. I said, &quot;Well, let's have a meeting so that you comply with your sentence of the court.&quot; He said to me in two different letters that there was nothing to talk about.\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Reagan did damage to Nicaragua beyond the imaginations of the people who are hearing me now. The ripple effects of that; criminal murderous interventions in my country will go on for what, 50 years or more.&quot; \r\n<br>\r\n<font align="right">—Miguel d'Escoto on the death of Ronald Reagan in 2004</font></p>	1983	1983	1	98	Democracy Now!	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:50.824675	2015-02-13 04:07:50.824675	\N

433	Pressing Charges	<p class="entry " style="color:white;">In July, the courts order the arrest of Emilio Massera for the murder of a mistress's husband, the businessman Fernando Branca, who was invited for a sail on the yacht Massera used as chief of the navy and never appeared.\r\n<br>\r\nIn September, the military junta passes an autoamnesty for all members of the military charged with human rights violations. In October the leader of the Radical Civic Union, Raul Aifonsin, wins the presidency with 52 percent of the vote; it is the first time the Peronist movement has been defeated in clean elections. He is sworn into office on December 10. The new Congress nullifies the autoamnesty. Alfonsin creates a presidential commission of leading members of the society to investigate human rights violations and asks the courts to press charges against Videla, Massera, and other leaders of the dirty war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;width:600px;">\r\n<b>An Excerpt from Massera's 2010 obituary:</b><br>\r\nKnown by some historians as the “grand orator” of the dictatorship for his captivating rhetoric, Mr. Massera operated the Naval Mechanics School, a clandestine prison known as ESMA where thousands of political prisoners were tortured over the six years of the regime, which collapsed in 1983.\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Massera was “the most sinister character in our history because he was a serial assassin, without exaggeration,” Osvaldo Bayer, an Argentine historian, said in a radio interview. “He took advantage of his uniform for power and money.”\r\n<br>\r\nA federal court convicted him in 1985 of crimes against humanity and sentenced him to life in prison. Then, in 1990, President Carlos Menem granted him and other coup leaders amnesty in what Mr. Menem called a gesture of reconciliation.\r\n<br>\r\nBorn in Buenos Aires in 1925, Mr. Massera was educated at Argentina’s elite naval academy and became a midshipman in 1946. He rose to the rank of full admiral and commander in chief under Mrs. Perón in 1974.\r\n<br>\r\nIn that post, he pressed Mrs. Perón to fight urban guerrilla groups, persuading her to push for laws to beef up security and to stop the insurgents at any cost. He was ruthless in enforcing measures to maintain public order.\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Massera ran the military arm of the dictatorship the first two years. As head of the navy, he was also in control of the prison camp at ESMA in Buenos Aires. The admiral visited the camp often, overseeing torture, which included rape. The military tortured most of its prisoners and dumped them, dead or alive, into the River Plate from airplanes. Mr. Massera studied philology as a young man and obsessed over the use of language. “He had a messianic oratory, a sonorous oratory,” said Marguerite Feitlowitz, a literature professor at Bennington College who has written a book about Argentina’s dictatorship. “His speeches were very evil and very polished.” In a speech in 1972 to officers who had been chosen to carry out the death flights, Mr. Massera said, “Death will not triumph here, because all of our dead, each and every one, died for the triumph of life.”\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mr. Massera was convicted of dozens of counts of murder, torture and robbery, he was unrepentant. “Nobody has to defend himself for having won a fair war,” Mr. Massera said after the trial. “The war against subversive terrorism was fair.” Despite Mr. Menem’s pardon, Mr. Massera was arrested in 1998 on charges of having stolen babies born to political prisoners, a crime not covered by the amnesty. His ill health kept him out of prison. In 2005, the Supreme Court, under the administration of President Néstor Kirchner (who died on Oct. 27), declared the amnesties unconstitutional. But the court, confirming Mr. Massera’s dementia, suspended all cases against him, as well as extradition requests from Germany, Spain, Italy and France. Those countries had sought him for the killings of their citizens during the dictatorship.\r\n<br>\r\n<b>NYTIMES</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n	1983	1983	1	3	<span style="color:white;">Horacio Verbitsky's Confessions of an Argentine Dirty Warrior</span>	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:50.85327	2015-02-13 04:07:50.85327	\N

Their deaths prompted a number of journalists to explore the network of &quot;Private&quot; - and ostensibly independent - religious, secular New Right and paramilitary organizations working with the contras. By 1984, the most prominent of the &quot;private&quot; donors were Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network, Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, Thomas V.

In January 1986, Christian Democrat leader Vinicio Cerezo was elected President and said he had &quot;the political will to respect the rights of man,&quot; but it didn't take long to find out that his political will was irrelevant in the face of Guatemala's well-oiled military machine. Hopes for change were dashed when Cerezo announced he would not nullify the &quot;self-amnesty law&quot; declared on the eve of his election by General Oscar Mejia Victores, <i>pictured</i>, establishing amnesty for all past military offenses committed from General Efrain Ríos Montt's coup in 1982 through the 1986 elections (<i>Pictured,</i> Ríos Montt).\r\n<br>&emsp;<span style="background-color:yellow;">\r\nAlthough Ronald Reagan's State Department asserted &quot;there has not been a single clear-cut case of political killing,&quot; within months of Cerezo's inauguration opposition leaders attributed 56 murders to security forces and death squads, while Americas Watch claimed that &quot;throughout 1986, violent killings were reported in the Guatemalan press at the rate of 100 per month.&quot;</span> Altogether, Americas Watch says, tens of thousands were killed and 400 rural villages were destroyed by government death squads during Reagan's term in office.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nColonel D'Jalma Dominguez, former army spokesman, explains: &quot;For convenience sake, a civilian government is preferable, such as the one we have now.

Equally poor nations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America have lower violence levels. The explanation for Guatemala's high level of violence probably is rooted in cultural and sociological factors unique to Guatemala. Guatemala is distinguished from other Central American nations by the duality of its culture where a wealthy ladino minority lives side by side with an impoverished Indian majority largely marginalized from national political and economic life. . . . The use of violence to settle disputes of almost any nature is accepted in Guatemala's indigenous culture.\r\nThe plantation system which historically generated Guatemala's exports and wealth has relied on Indian labor to function. . . .<br>&emsp;\r\nFear of revolution stems from the Arbenz period when the first political efforts to involve peasants and Indians in national life began in earnest. . . .

Death squad activity and human rights abuses drastically increased shortly after. \r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nDuring the 1960s and the 1970s the Pentagon continued to be the main source of foreign support for the Honduran armed forces. On the economic front, the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) provided grants and loans for the construction of hydroelectric dams highways and rural roads, as well as for farm credit, agroexport pro motion, public administration, grain marketing, private enterprise promotion, and public administration. Bolstered by U.S. funds and supplies, nongovernmental organizations like CARE, the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD), and Partners of the Americas began operations in Honduras.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nPrior to the late 1970s there was little U.S. pressure for Honduras to shift from military to civilian rule. Suddenly, however, U.S. hegemony in Central America was threatened by the Sandinista challenge to Anastasio Somoza of Nicaragua and the rise of leftist movements in Guatemala and El Salvador. Bordering all three countries, Honduras gained new strategic importance for Washington and\r\nsoon came to occupy a pivotal position in U.S. policy toward Central America.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe outlines of U.S. foreign policy became apparent soon after the\r\nSandinista victory in July 1979. Secretary of State for Inter-American\r\nAffairs Viron Vacky presented a major policy report to Congress in\r\nSeptember 1979 in which he pointed out that "Honduras' geographical position gives it a key role in preventing regional conflicts and potential infiltrations." Even before the ouster of Somoza, however, the\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nCarter administration had begun to pay closer attention to the political stability of Honduras. In 1978 the State Department began Working with the military junta led by Gen. Policarpo Paz to facilitate a\r\ntransition to civilian rule in 1980.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nInstituting a policy that would later be repeated in El Salvador and Guatemala, the Carter administration adopted a dual program  of political reform and militarization. With an election schedule in place\r\nand a promise by the military to cede direct control of the government to the political parties, the United States stepped up its commitment of economic and military aid to Honduras in 1980. To bolster the Honduran military's capacity to patrol the Nicaraguan and Salvadoran borders, the Carter administration loaned the Honduras air force ten Huey helicopters. At the same time the U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) sent a Special Forces team to Honduras to instruct the armed forces in border security operations.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Building It Up"></div>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/honduranmilitaryexercise2.jpg" style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0; max-width: 1060px; clip: rect(0px,1020px,720px,0px);">\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="height: 524px;position: relative;top: 83px;background-color:rgba(255,255,255,.6);padding: 9px;left: -10px;width: 867px;">\r\n&emsp;\r\nThe Carter administration moved quickly to help Honduras adapt to its new geopolitical role. It brokered a provisional agreement in October 1980 to settle the long-running border dispute between\r\nHonduras and EI Salvador. This agreement provided for joint border\r\npatrols and granted the Salvadoran army access to the pockets of disputed\r\nborder territory (known as <i>bolsones</i>) where Salvadoran guerrillas\r\nwere camped. The expanding cooperation between the two armies\r\nhad severe consequences for the thousands of Salvadoran refugees\r\nfleeing into Honduras. In one bloody incident some 600 Salvadorans\r\nwere killed, mostly by Honduran troops, as they attempted to cross\r\nthe Sumpul River into Honduras. Besides taking an active role in the\r\nSalvadoran conflict, the Honduran armed forces were also pressured\r\nby the United States to patrol the Nicaraguan border to prevent the\r\nalleged smuggling of weapons through Honduras into EI Salvador.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe Carter policy of political reform seasoned with generous\r\ndoses of militarization established the foundation for massive injections\r\nof military and economic aid by the Reagan administration. Like\r\nCarter, President Reagan recognized that a civilian government in\r\nHonduras was essential to the credibility of U.S. claims that its main\r\nforeign policy goal in Central America was to shore up democratic\r\ngovernments. Under Reagan the strategic significance of Honduras\r\nincreased as the country became the launching ground for the Nicaraguan\r\ncontra war. In the early 1980s the role assigned to Honduras\r\nin the regional crisis expanded from containment to counterrevolution.\r\n4 The U.S. diplomatic corps, swelling to over 1,300, became one\r\nof the largest in the world.\r\nDelineating Washington's expectations of its alliance with\r\nTegucigalpa, Assistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams explained:\r\nOur political objectives for Honduras are clear: to strengthen democracy\r\nand democratic institutions, to elicit full cooperation\r\nagainst nondemocratic forces in the region, to encourage regional\r\ncooperation and solidarity, and to obtain the greatest\r\nHonduran support possible for our objectives in the region and\r\nelsewhere. Our economic objectives must bolster and reinforce\r\nour overall objectives, which can and would be undermined if political\r\nand social progress is not achieved.5\r\nIn the 1980s U.S. foreign policy did succeed in eliciting Honduran\r\ncooperation for its program of counterrevolution and militarization.\r\nDuring the years 1980-89, Honduras received over $1.6 billion in direct\r\nU.s. military and economic aid. Largely as a result of this aid,\r\nHonduras became, as President Suazo had once reminded President\r\nReagan, Washington's "closest ally" in Central America.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nInterdependence between the two countries deepened during th('\r\n1980s. Large sums of U.S. economic assistance kept the economy\r\nafloat, and large allocations of U.S. military aid kept the armed forceH\r\nacquiescent in the face of the "democratization" process and the expanding\r\ncontra presence. For its part, Washington relied on Honduras\r\nfor close cooperation in its war of destabilization against.\r\nNicaragua. Honduras became the base for a U.S. military build-up allowing\r\nthe Pentagon to construct an extensive infrastructure of air\r\nfields, bases, and radar sites in the country.\r\n</p>	1984	1990	1	48	 	large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:50.978633	2015-02-13 04:07:50.978633	\N

446	Who Is That Dwarf?	<p class="entry columns">As the United States geared up for its attack on popular organizations and social reform in Central America in the 1980s, Costa Rica continued to cooperate, but with insufficient enthusiasm from the Reaganite perspective, particularly under the Arias government. Arias accepted the basic norms, lauding Washington's terror states as &quot;democracies,&quot; condemning the Sandinistas for failing to observe the regional standards to which the U.S. clients conform, and assuring the press that &quot;I told Mr. Shultz that the Sandinistas today are bad guys, and you are good guys, that they have unmasked themselves&quot; by the repression at Nandaime. But this level of support for U.S.-backed terror did not suffice for the jingoist right, offended by the fact that Arias joined general Latin American opinion in opposing overt U.S. violence in the region. In September 1987, according to the Council on Hemispheric Affairs (COHA), he was summoned to the White House to receive a &quot;stern lecture&quot; from Reagan, prepared by Elliott Abrams, warning him not to appeal directly to Congress to terminate contra aid. In previous months, delay of aid to Costa Rica and other pressures had served as a warning of what might be in store. When Arias responded with critical remarks about U.S. policy, COHA reports, &quot;the outraged Reagan was heard to exclaim as Arias took his leave, &quot;Who is that dwarf?&quot;</p>	1987	1987	1	31	Necessary Illusions by Noam Chomsky	medium	f	2015-02-13 04:07:50.988694	2015-02-13 04:07:50.988694	\N

The bleeding of the New World became an act of charity, an argument for the faith. With the guilt, a whole system of rationalizations for guilty consciences was devised. The Indians were used as beasts of burden because they could carry a greater weight than the delicate llama, and this proved that they were in fact beasts of burden. The viceroy of Mexico felt that there was no better remedy for their &quot;natural wickedness&quot; than work in the mines. Juan Gines de Sepulveda, a renowned Spanish theologian, argued that they deserved the treatment they got because their sins and idolatries were an offense to God. The Count de Buffon, a French naturalist, noted that Indians were cold and weak creatures in whom &quot;no activity of the soul&quot; could be observed. The Abbe De Paw invented a Latin America where degenerate Indians lived side by side with dogs that couldn't bark, cows that couldn't be eaten, and impotent camels. Voltaire's Latin America was inhabited by Indians who were lazy and stupid, pigs with navels on their backs, and bald and cowardly lions. Bacon, De Maistre, Montesquieu, Hume, and Bodin declined to recognize the &quot;degraded men&quot; of the New World as fellow humans. Hegel spoke of Latin America's physical and spiritual impotence and said the Indians died when Europe merely breathed on them.\r\n<br>&emsp;&emsp;\r\nIn the seventeenth century Father Gregorio Garcia detected Semitic blood in the Indians because, like the Jews, &quot;they are lazy, they do not believe in the miracles of Jesus Christ, and they are ungrateful to the Spaniards for all the good they have done them.&quot; At least this holy man did not deny that the Indians were descended from Adam and Eve: many theologians and thinkers had never been convinced by Pope Paul III's bull of 1537 declaring the Indians to be &quot;true men.&quot; When Bartolomé de las Casas upset the Spanish Court with his heated denunciations of the conquistadors' cruelty in 1557, a member of the Royal Council replied that Indians were too low in the human scale to be capable of receiving the faith. Las Casas dedicated his zealous life to defending the Indians against the excesses of the mine owners and encomenderos. He once remarked that the Indians preferred to go to hell to avoid meeting Christians.\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Depiction of Blemmyes, engraving in a 1603 German edition of Sir Walter Raleigh’s Discovery of Guiana, 1595.</strong>\r\n\r\n</p>	1557	1557	9	42	Open Veins of Latin America	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:51.160326	2015-02-13 04:07:51.160326	\N

Electricity to the capital, Tegucigalpa, was cut, as were telephone lines and cell phone service. \r\n<br>\r\nSOA-trained Honduran Army Attorney Col. Herberth Inestroza justified the military coup and stated in an interview with the Miami Herald , &quot;It would be difficult for us, with our training, to have a relationship with a leftist government.

The crisis in Honduras began when the military refused to distribute ballot boxes for a referendum to determine whether or not a majority of Hondurans want to enter a process to modify their constitution.  In response, President Zelaya fired the head of the military, SOA graduate General Romeo Vasquez Velasquez. The heads of all branches of the armed forces then quit in solidarity with Vasquez. Vasquez, however, refused to step down, bolstered by a Court ruling that reinstated him. Vasquez remains in control of the armed forces.\r\n<br>\r\nVasquez Velasquez, along with Honduran Air Force, General Luis Prince Suazo and other coup leaders, graduated from the SOA. Records show that Vasquez Velasquez took a basic combat arms course at SOA in 1976 and another course on small military units in 1984, while Prince Suazo took a 1996 course on joint operations. While a repressive campaign against the ensuing resistance is unleashed, the U.S. refuses to call the overthrow a military coup and the Obama administration undermines efforts to restore democracy.</p>	2009	2009	1	83		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:51.581265	2015-02-13 04:07:51.581265	\N
558	US Marines Occupy 1912-25	<div class="page" data-title="Background"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="position:relative;top:350px;">\r\n\r\n<strong>1912-25</strong>\r\n<br><i> Occupation of U.S. Marines maintains Conservatives in power in face of continued Liberal rebellion in Nicaragua.</i>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst the background of 17 years of dictatorship under Jose Santos Zelaya, with its aftermath of revolutions, and in the context of the impending completion of the Panama Canal, the United States supported conservative President Adolfo Diaz in the Nicaraguan revolution of 1912. The conflict began with the falling out of Diaz and his war minister, General Luis Mena, who then took command of the revolutionary army. As a result, on August 1, 1912, the New York Times reported that the United States had ordered the 500-ton gunboat Annapolis to proceed from San Juan del Sur to Corinto (both located along the Nicaraguan west coast) to protect Americans and American interests.\r\n<br>\r\nThe intervention got underway on August 4, at the request of the Diaz government, with the landing of 100 blue-jackets and Marines from the Annapolis. An estimated 3,500 Nicaraguan Government regulars at Managua were opposing a rebel force set at 2,300. Other revolutionists were operating in several communities along the Nicaraguan west coast. As August wore on and United States presence expanded, the insurgents bombarded Managua.\r\n<br>\r\nOn August 28, because of massacres and an impending attack on Managua, President William Howard Taft directed the dispatch of the Army's Tenth Infantry from Panama to Nicaragua. Twelve hours later, however, he rescinded the order on assurance from the cruiser Denver at Corinto that sufficient Marine and Naval personnel were on hand to protect Americans until reinforcements would arrive.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Zissa's Letters"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\nThe reinforcements-750 Marines who sailed from Philadelphia on August 24 and crossed the Isthmus of Panama by train-arrived at Corinto on September 4. Among them was one Pennsylvania Marine,  Sgt Frank F. Zissa, whose letters from the scene, published over seventy years later, substantially tell the story of action that ensued.\r\n<br>\r\n"<i>Pen and ink is out of the question just at present, so pencil writing must do. All we have with us is what each man carries in his knapsack and haversack. One containing extra clothing, shoes, etc., and the other mess gear....\r\n<br>\r\n"This is only about 40 miles from Corinto inland but it took eleven hours to get here....The whole railroad system, which consists of about 90 miles of track and possibly a dozen engines with its other rolling stock, is owned entirely by American capital.\r\n<br>\r\nThe road runs into the interior as far as Managua.... The Liberals, who are known to us as the rebels, are in possession of nearly every town and city except Managua. This is still held by the Federals, but as we are given to understand, the Liberals will soon occupy that too.\r\n<br>\r\n"We have about 2,000 men in the country so far. Sailors from the (cruisers) California and Colorado make up about 800, and there are 1,200 Marines. We don't take part in their troubles here as long as they don't attempt to molest Americans or American interests. The people do not look upon our presence in their country with much favor, but they cannot help themselves for we have an armed force large enough to put them out of business should they start anything.\r\n<br>\r\n"They have a large army, but all their rifles are old-fashioned, whereas we are equipped with everything modem. There is no danger (of their) bothering us for they understand fully if one shot is fired at us by them, it means war and in that case they would probably lose their country altogether.\r\n<br>\r\n"Whenever we discover that they have anything that belongs to the railroad or to an American individual we just send a company of men, armed of course, and demand the property, which is soon given up by them....Guards are stationed at all bridges and other important points to prevent the renewal of destruction by the rebels.\r\n<br>\r\n"All trains also carry heavy guards to prevent their seizure. At all important towns along the line several companies of either Marines or sailors are stationed as a protection for Americans or other foreigners.\r\n<br>\r\n"At this place, Leon, we have a full battalion, for it is the largest city in the country. About forty thousand, I understand. This city is a rebel stronghold, but there are also a lot of the other side and consequently nearly everyone goes armed. One doesn't trust the other. Arms of all makes and descriptions can be seen, but the majority carry long saber-like knives or dirks. Even the women go armed.\r\n<br>\r\n"A week or so before our arrival they had a battle right in the city, in which two Americans were killed and several dozens of natives. The town is pretty quiet now though, except when they get news of a victory over the Federals from other sections. Then they celebrate by ringing all church bells, cheering, firing crackers, and (making) noise otherwise.\r\n<br>\r\n"We are located a half mile outside of the town, from where all details and guards (are) sent wherever required. It is awfully hot here during the day.... The language spoken is Spanish throughout and we have little trouble getting along with them as we have several interpreters in each company.\r\n<br>\r\n"The dress of the womenfolk is quite picturesque, although of cheap material. Their garments are mostly bright colored goods.... For headdress they use a scarf, which is removed when out of the sun and put about the shoulders....\r\n<br>\r\nEarly mornings they can be seen coming from all directions, heading toward the city with baskets of produce or prepared edibles for the market.... It seemed awful strange to me at first to see a crowd of these women come along with baskets upon their heads, hands down the side, for they need not steady them, marching along just as straight as can be...</i>"\r\n<br>\r\nThe peaceful tone of this letter reflected the premature general belief at the time that the situation was well in hand. But a few days later the revolution and the United States forces' role both began to heat up.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Heating Up"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\n\r\n \r\nClyde H. Metcalf's "A History of the United States Marine Corps," published by G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York, in 1939, records that two Marine artillery batteries, along with Butler's battalion, took a position near Coyotepe Hill (300 feet high) the night of October 2-3 under the overall command of Marine Col Joseph H. Pendleton. The rebel commander, Gen Zeledon, a former war secretary of Zelaya's cabinet, refused to surrender when given a final opportunity to do so.\r\n<br>\r\n"<i>We were in little danger from them however as their guns did not carry as far as ours. We were in position about 2,000 yards from the summit of the hills, and our shots did not all count as (we) had to locate just where their trenches and redoubts were.\r\n<br>\r\nEvery once in a while a shot would count though as we could see them come out from behind embankments and get on the opposite side of the hills. This was the object, to dislodge their guns and drive them off so that the infantry companies which were near at hand could advance and take the place with as little loss of life as possible.\r\n<br>\r\n"We could not dislodge them altogether from where we were, so we moved closer towards evening. It was dark by that time so we stopped firing that day, with the hills still in the possession of the rebels.\r\n<br>\r\n"About midnight we opened up on them again, but only about five shots as they made things interesting for us every time we fired. The flash of our guns gave them our location and a hail of bullets greeted us every time as they possibly had outposts not very far away from us. We decided to stop firing before they would (hit) one of our gun crews.\r\n<br>\r\n"At daybreak we started in on them again and the infantry companies (Marines and sailors) advanced upon their position, firing as they went. We had the hills and Old Glory flying on top within an hour of the time the fighting started.\r\n<br>\r\n"Our loss was four men killed and about ten wounded. The rebels left 32 dead and a small number wounded, besides a lot of prisoners were taken. They were turned over to the Federals, who made them prisoners of war. Most of the rebels escaped to the town of Masaya.\r\n<br>\r\n"There were possibly three or four hundred entrenched on the hills. As soon as the hills were taken by us, about 1,000 Federals were on hand to pass into the town of Masaya, where they fought for several hours in the streets, killing many on both sides. The rebels were finally routed with heavy loss and the Federals took possession of the town the rebels had held against them so long because they could not dislodge them from the approach to the place-the hills we had to gain for them.</i>"\r\n<br>\r\nIn his 1939 history, Metcalf wrote that as the attack reached its swift climax early in the morning of October 4 (Friday) Pendleton's forces comprised the First Battalion under Maj William N. McKelvy, the Third Battalion under Butler, with two Marine companies and a company of sailors from the Annapolis, plus a battalion of sailors from the California, placed east of Coyotepe Hill. He added that no Nicaraguan troops joined the assault although some had agreed to.\r\n<br>\r\nPendleton sent an 8 a.m. message from Coyotepe to Southerland at Managua, reporting: "The American flag now flies over Coyotepe and Barranca. We took Coyotepe and then also drove rebels from Barranca in thirty-seven minutes... only American forces stormed Coyotepe."\r\n<br>\r\nSoutherland himself issued four news dispatches from Managua on October 4, saying that the hills had been taken by Marines and bluejackets "after a most gallant assault," Masaya was taken by the government forces, the railroad between Managua and Granada was now safe, "and the starving inhabitants of Masaya will be relieved."\r\n<br>\r\nThe United States Legation in Nicaragua supplied an additional fact for the State Department, informing it that Zeledon had fled with his followers and was captured, dying shortly afterward.\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Leon"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\nZissa's official military record summarized his own part in the matter with the note: "Participated in bombardment, assault and capture of the fortifications of Coyotepe and Barranca at Managua, Nicaragua, October 3-4, 1912."\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the deep involvement of the United States produced criticism in the U.S., the performance of the Marines and sailors evoked praise. The Times, one of the critics, conceded for instance on October 7: "The bravery of our Marines who faced the Nicaraguan machine guns at (Coyotepe) and captured that rebel stronghold and Barranca, is not likely to be disputed..."\r\n<br>\r\nThat this climax to the conflict was not the end of the story was indicated by Southerland's announcement that LtCol C.G. Long "will now be given a force of 1,200 men at Leon, consisting of the First and second Battalions of Marines and the entire bluejacket companies of the California and the Colorado."\r\n<br>\r\nWhat then occurred at Leon was detailed by Zissa in the remainder of his October 9 letter to his future wife Flora Huetter, telling her that he and his fellow Marines "<i>found things pretty bad for ourselves upon returning here to Leon.\r\n<br>\r\n"This place,</i>" he went on, "<i>is about 75 miles from Granada and of course the news (of) how we had treated their fellow revolutionists at the other place had reached them. This made them rather aggressive towards us and before they had a chance to think it over our commander ordered them to surrender and turn in all their firearms and such other war material that might be in their possession.\r\n<br>\r\n"In the meantime we had assembled a force of over 1,000 Marines and sailors near the city to back up our demands.\r\n<br>\r\n"Leon is the largest city of the country, having a population of about 60,000 (other accounts concur with his first figure of 40,000) and it was a thorough rebel town-about 4,000 soldiers being in and about the place to protect it from invasion by government troops. The demands of our commander to the rebel chiefs were complied with as far as these chiefs could.\r\n<br>\r\n"On the morning of October 6 (Sunday), all the chiefs rode into our camp and surrendered the town to our commander, but they also informed him that they could not control all their soldiers as many had refused to give up their arms and had decided to fight us to the bitter end (should) we attempt to disarm them and take over their city.\r\n<br>\r\n"Well, anyway, two o'clock in the afternoon of the same day was the hour set when we would march in and take the city, no matter what the consequences might be in the attempt. Our officers knew by now what would happen and prepared accordingly. Our forces were distributed at different points on the outskirts of the town, and at the given hour all proceeded to march in to take possession.\r\n<br>\r\n"The rebels opened fire immediately upon our men from windows, housetops, church steeples, towers, and other places of concealment. Our men of course replied and went right on distributing men along the streets, disarming every rebel they could find. This was dangerous business and we had three men killed and about 12 wounded.</i> (Metcalf listed one Marine and two sailors killed, two Marines and one sailor wounded, and nearly 50 rebels killed.)\r\n<br>\r\n"<i>We had to go through houses and backyards looking for firearms and, frequently, shots were fired from some unseen place. If such place was discovered, a volley of our rifles would turn towards it and blaze away. Our men shelled several church towers where the rebels had machine guns in position and (had) done some damage to us. These places were all taken over by our men as the rebels were driven from them for they could not withstand the firing from our rifles very long.</i>"\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Refusal"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\n\r\n"<i>The fighting continued all afternoon and by dark very few of the defiant rebels were left in the town as they took to the hills outside of the city before the bullets of our guns. Many of them of course had to stay and be buried. Our doctors took charge of all wounded on both sides. Just how many natives were killed has not been given out by the authorities but there were quite a few-anyway a whole lot more than on our side.\r\n<br>\r\n"Many families of the town had left days before the trouble started and those that had stayed kept to their house with doors and everything barred while the fighting went on in the streets.\r\n<br>\r\n"By dark everything was quiet all over the city except the little noise our men made patrolling the streets. Believe me, every Marine and sailor in the town was wide awake that night and prepared to shoot any native who might attempt to make a crooked move. This of course was necessary for the protection of our lives.\r\n<br>\r\n"More trouble was expected the next morning but the lesson of the previous day seemed to have put fear of an American bullet into every native in the town. No more shots were fired on either side and quiet (reigned) all over the city, with our officers and men in full control.\r\n<br>\r\n"Until this day all natives of the place had been wearing red ribbons either on their hats, or red streamers in the lapel of the coat. This was the color of the revolutionists. The womenfolk in sympathy with the revolutionary movement wore red ribbons in their hair or about the waist. The town gave one the impression of a holiday celebration, with everyone wearing bright red colors of some shape or form.\r\n<br>\r\n"There was a big change though on the morning of the seventh, the day after we took possession. Every native appearing on the streets was in sober dress, devoid of any red color of any description as the wearing of red meant an enemy to us and they were liable to arrest or be shot if resistance was offered.\r\n<br>\r\n"This is Thursday, and ever since Sunday the most of our men have been patrolling the streets and searching houses for rifles and ammunition. The city is under martial law and it is the intention of our commander to disarm all natives, take everything in the line of firearms from them to discourage their revolutionary ideas and lead a more peaceful (existence) among themselves.\r\n<br>\r\n''The people of the town are becoming more friendly every day to our men patrolling the streets....Most of the time the last few weeks we were obliged to sleep wherever we might happen to be.... Yesterday was the first time in six days I had a chance to remove my shoes and get a little rest...</i>"\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\nSoutherland reported that Long's forces assumed complete control of the city and that the railroad was now safe from Corinto to Granada. The commander expected that peace would be general throughout the republic in less than a week. Nicaragua's abrupt disappearance from newspaper headlines in the United States indicated that his prediction was fulfilled.\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time of his next letter on November 14, Zissa had learned that his company was among three Marine companies selected to remain in Nicaragua while the others were to leave for Panama and the United States. His company then went to Managua as legation guard.\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Camp Elliott, Panama, January 27,1913, Zissa told of his departure from Corinto on January 10. In retrospect, at the time of writing, he realized he "was beginning to like it at Managua" and "would rather be in Nicaragua fighting rebels than stay here any length of time."\r\n<br>\r\nBut Zissa got used to Panama also, and he was later to write that he "<i>was on hand to see the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific meet when the canal was finished.</i>" The first ship passed through the waterway on August 15,1914, marking the climax of the canal's own role in the Nicaraguan revolution.\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\r\n<p style="background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\nThe 1912 intervention by units of Marines and armed sailors  ended the civil conflict  and essentially destroyed the rebel forces, but provided no guarantee of  future stability. Determined to prevent civil conflicts, the United States left  a company-sized force in Managua, ostensibly to guard the American legation, but actually to serve as an indicator of Washington’s refusal to tolerate \r\nefforts at armed revolution.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Sources"></div>\r\n<p class="entry" style="position:relative;top:350px;">\r\nExcerpts from Nicaragua, 1912 By Robert F.

Governor Pedro Rosello, who had been privatizing industries and farms since elected, once again proposed privatizing the PRTC, and a one day General Strike in 1997 temporarily halted the sale. The statehood parties suggested the PRTC was a heavy burden to the budget even though it brought in revenues, and the Puerto Rico Independence Party and trade unions contested these claims, as even conservative thinktanks considered it modern and it made a profit of $130 million in 1996. Police attacked the June strikes of PRTC workers and the violent clashes led to the involvement of fifty more unions. A general strike was called in July of 1998, with half a million workers participating. After forty-four days, the strike was called off when the government promised no reprisals, but the privatization and sale of the PRTC went ahead in 1999.</p>	1995	1999	5	67		medium	f	2015-02-13 04:07:51.232426	2015-02-13 04:07:51.232426	\N

499	The Machete Wielders	<table style="position:relative;top:-20px;"><tr><td width="520">\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="font-size:.95em;"><strong>The FBI assassinates 72-year old Filiberto Ojeda Rios, leader of the Boricua Popular Army, Los Macheteros (the Machete Wielders). </strong><br>\r\n&emsp;Ojeda Rios (1933-2005) led a life of revolutionary activity in Puerto Rico as early as 1961, when he first went underground. He was arrested in 1970, after being accused of belonging to armed anti-colonial insurgency groups, but he evaded prosecution by again returning underground. Later, in 1978, he helped found the Ejercito Popular Boricua-Macheteros, also known as Los Macheteros. Notorious for its brazen attacks on U.S. military interests, the guerrillas proclaimed their goal of securing the independence of Puerto Rico through revolutionary action.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;In 1985, the FBI launched raids against independence activists across the island, angering even the local Commonwealth government, which had not been warned in advance. After a dramatic firefight, Ojeda Rios was among those arrested, but was later acquitted. While his acquittal was for charges stemming from his armed resistance to the FBI's arrest attempt—which he claimed was an assassination attempt—the real charges brought by the FBI immediately after the acquittal included seditious conspiracy and charges for the 1983 Wells Fargo bank heist, which the Macheteros publicly took credit for. Ojeda Rios knew that they had been pursuing him since the late 1960s and was clear on the need to protect his life and his organization.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Ojeda Rios returned underground in 1990, causing widespread embarrassment to the FBI. Over the next 15 years, his would be the voice of rebellion and revolution, of social justice, of the working class, and of his ultimate vision of a Puerto Rico emancipated from the dependency and control of U.S. colonialism. His name and figure became legendary; his voice and image repeatedly emerged in the form of videos, voice recordings, and even exclusive TV interviews.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Unrelenting in its pursuit, the FBI sent Quantico's Hostage Rescue Team to attack Ojeda Rios's home in the mountains of Hormigueros in September 2005. Elma Beatriz Rosado, his wife, safely made it out of the home during the firefight that ensued. She witnessed the ambush in which Ojeda Rios was left to bleed to death after an FBI sniper's single bullet wounded him. News reports suggested that agents tampered with the scene, and officials at FBI headquarters discussed portraying the incident as a suicide in order to cover up misconduct.\r\n</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width="75"></td>\r\n\r\n<td width="400" valign="top">\r\n\r\n<p class="bigquote" style="font-size:26px;">\r\n&quot;Puerto Rico has a history that is very heroic and prolific.

The perpetrators were Salvadoran criminals operating under the direction of Luis Posada Carriles and financed in Miami. One of the most notorious international terrorists, Posada had escaped from a Venezuelan prison, where he had been held for the Cubana airliner bombing, with the aid of Jorge Mas Canosa, a Miami businessman who was the head of the tax-exempt Cuban-American National Foundation (CANF). Posada went from Venezuela to El Salvador, where he was put to work at the Ilopango military air base to help organize US terrorist attacks against Nicaragua under Oliver North's direction.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Posada has described in detail his terrorist activities and the funding for them from exiles and CANF in Miami, but felt secure that he would not be investigated by the FBI. He was a Bay of Pigs veteran, and his subsequent operations in the 1960s were directed by the CIA. When he later joined Venezuelan intelligence with CIA help, he was able to arrange for Orlando Bosch, an associate from his CIA days who had been convicted in the US for a bomb attack on a Cuba-bound freighter, to join him in Venezuela to organize further attacks against Cuba. An ex-CIA official familiar with the Cubana bombing identifies Posada and Bosch as the only suspects in the bombing, which Bosch defended as &quot;a legitimate act of war.&quot; Generally considered the &quot;mastermind&quot; of the airline bombing, Bosch was responsible for thirty other acts of terrorism, according to the FBI. He was granted a presidential pardon in 1989 by the incoming Bush I administration after intense lobbying by Jeb Bush and South Florida Cuban-American leaders, overruling the Justice Department, which had found the conclusion &quot;inescapable that it would be prejudicial to the public interest for the United States to provide a safe haven for Bosch [because] the security of this nation is affected by its ability to urge credibly other nations to refuse aid and shelter to terrorists.&quot;<br>\r\n&emsp;As for the 1997 bombings?<br>\r\n&emsp;Cuban offers to cooperate in intelligence-sharing with the Clinton Administration to prevent terrorist attacks have been rejected by Washington, though some did lead to US actions. "Senior members of the FBI visited Cuba in 1998 to meet their Cuban counterparts, who gave [the FBI] dossiers about what they suggested was a Miami-based terrorist network: information which had been compiled in part by Cubans who had infiltrated exile groups." Three months later the FBI arrested, not the terrorists, but Cubans who had infiltrated the US-based terrorist groups. Five were sentenced to long terms in prison. They are now known as the Cuban Five (two have since been released after over a decade in prison).\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="caption"><i>Pictured</i>, Giustino di Celmo holds a portrait of his son, Fabio.</p>	1997	1997	1	32	Hegemony or Survival Chomsky	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:51.330291	2015-02-13 04:07:51.330291	\N

He is killed in 2004 under mysterious circumstances.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns">The Colombia Plan is officially justified in terms of the &quot;drug war,&quot; a claim taken seriously by few competent analysts. The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reports that &quot;all branches of government&quot; in Colombia are involved in &quot;drug-related corruption.&quot; In November 1998, US Customs and DEA inspectors found 415 kg of cocaine and 6 kg of heroin in a Colombian Air Force plane that had landed in Florida, leading to the arrest of several Air Force officers and enlisted personnel. Other observers too have reported the heavy involvement of the military in narcotrafficking, and the US military has also been drawn in. The wife of Colonel James Hiett pleaded guilty to conspiracy to smuggle heroin from Colombia to New York, and shortly after, it was reported that Colonel Hiett himself, who is in charge of US troops that trained Colombian security forces in &quot;counternarcotics operations,&quot; was &quot;expected to plead guilty&quot; to charges of complicity. The paramilitaries openly proclaim their reliance on the drug business. &quot;The leader of the paramilitaries [Carlos Castano] acknowledged in a television interview that the drug trade provided 70 percent of the group's funding,&quot; correspondent John Donnelly reported in March 2000. This was the first appearance on Colombian TV of Castano, who heads the largest and most brutal of the paramilitary organizations. He claimed to command a force of 11,200 men &quot;financed by extortion and income from 30,000 hectares of coca fields in Norte de Santander.&quot;  But &quot;the US-financed attack stays clear of the areas controlled by paramilitary forces,&quot; Donnelly observes, as have many others. The targets of the Colombia Plan are guerrilla forces based on the peasantry and calling for internal social change, which would interfere with integration of Colombia into the global system on the terms that the US demands: dominated by elites linked to US power interests that are accorded privileged access to Colombia's valuable resources, including oil—quite possibly a significant factor behind the Colombia Plan.</p>	1998	1998	1	30	Rogue States By Noam Chomsk	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:51.361239	2015-02-13 04:07:51.361239	\N

488	Written in English, Not Spanish	<p class="entry columns"><img src="/mapimages/clintonpastrana.gif" style="float:right;padding:0px 10px; width:66%;">\r\nIn 1999, Colombia became the leading recipient of US military and police assistance, replacing Turkey (Israel and Egypt are in a separate category). Colombia receives more US military aid than the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean combined. The total for 1999 reached about $300 million, along with $60 million in arms sales, approximately a threefold increase from 1998. The figure is scheduled to increase still more sharply with the anticipated passage of some version of Clinton's Colombia Plan, submitted to Congress in April 2000, which called for a $1.6 billion &quot;emergency aid&quot; package for two years. Through the 1990s, Colombia has been by far the leading recipient of US military aid in Latin America, and has also compiled by far the worst human rights record, in conformity with a well-established and long-standing correlation.<br>\r\nIn theory, &quot;Plan Colombia&quot; is a two-year Colombian government program of $7.5 billion, with the US providing the military muscle and token funds for other purposes, and some $6 billion from the Colombian government, Europe, the IMF, and the World Bank for social and economic programs that Colombia is to prepare. According to non-US diplomats, the draft of &quot;Plan Colombia&quot; was written in English, not Spanish. The military program (arms, training, intelligence infrastructure) was in place in late 1999, but &quot;the Colombian govern-ment has yet to present a coherent social investment program&quot; as of mid-2000, and few governments are &quot;willing to climb aboard what is widely perceived as an American project to clean up its backyard,&quot; by means that are familiar to those who do not choose what has been called &quot;intentional ignorance.&quot;\r\n<br>\r\nThe Colombian Commission of Jurists reported in September 1999 that the rate of killings had increased by almost 20 percent over the preceding year, and that the proportion attributable to the paramilitaties had risen from 46 percent in 1995 to almost 80 percent in 1998, continuing through 1999. The Colombian government's Human Rights Ombudsman's Office (Defensoria del Pueblo) reported a 68 percent increase in massacres in the first half of 1999 as compared to the same period of 1998, reaching more than one a day, overwhelmingly attributed to paramilitaries. Daniel Bland, a human rights researcher who worked in Colombia through most of the 1990s, concludes that in the past three years alone, &quot;more than a million people have been forced from their homes in the countryside, and between 5,000 and 7,000 unarmed peasants have been slaughtered by right-wing paramilitaries.&quot; Of nine people he interviewed for a documentary on human rights in 1997—professors, journalists, priests, human rights workers—&quot;three have since been murdered by paramilitary gunmen; four have fled with their families after receiving death threats.&quot; UNICEF and the Colombian Human Rights Information Bureau CODRES estimate that in June-August 1999 alone, 200,000 more people were driven from their homes.</p>\r\n<p><i>Colombian President Andrés Pastrana (left) and U.S. President Bill Clinton. </i>(Stephen Jaffe)</p>	1999	1999	1	30	Rogue States, Chomsky	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:51.422754	2015-02-13 04:07:51.422754	\N

Economic warfare was made still more stringent in 1996, causing a furor even among the closest US allies. The embargo came under considerable domestic criticism as well, on the grounds that it harms US exporters and investors—the embargo's only victims, according to the standard picture in the US; Cubans are unaffected.

556	The Gadsden Treaty	<p class="entry columns">\r\n<i>The Gadsden Treaty results in a redefinition of the United States-Mexico boundary. The United States gains additional land from Mexico, most notably the resource rich areas of southern New Mexico.</i><br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/gadsdenpurchase.gif" style="float:left; padding: 0px 7px;">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt took many decades for the United States to pacify the area along its southern\r\nboundary, as part of a process of bringing “order” and “civilization” to a region perceived \r\nas one of lawlessness and chaos. But instability in the border region was a concern for\r\nboth the United States and Mexico, often leading to tensions between the two countries\r\nfollowing transboundary attacks by hostile parties. Article 11 of the Treaty of Guadalupe\r\nHidalgo required the United States to prevent incursions into Mexico by native peoples\r\nbecause the United States was gaining territory inhabited by “savage tribes.” Yet, for a\r\nnumber of years, the United States did not patrol its southern boundary. Its negligence not\r\nonly facilitated many transboundary Indian attacks against Mexico, but also those by U.S.\r\nfilibusters intent on wresting control of territory from Mexico. Over the decades\r\nfollowing the end of the war, a number of Texas-based filibusters attempted to “liberate”\r\nnortheast Mexico. Simultaneously, French and American filibusters used California as a\r\nbase from which to launch invasions of Sonora and Baja California. Mexico repeatedly\r\naccused the United States of not enforcing its own neutrality law requiring the federal\r\ngovernment to prosecute anyone in the United States planning, organizing, or engaging in\r\nmilitary expeditions against a country with which the United States was at peace.\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, however, the United States and Mexico had to resolve a boundary dispute\r\nunintentionally created by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which relied on inaccurate\r\nmaps to define the boundary of the territory of New Mexico and the Mexican states of\r\nSonora and Chihuahua. U.S. expansionists wanted to see the boundary line as far south as\r\npossible to gain a more favorable route for a transcontinental railroad and to ensure U.S.\r\naccess to the rich mines in the area of Mesilla (in present-day southern New Mexico).\r\nTensions flared as repatriated Mexicans and Anglo-Texan and New Mexican cattle\r\nranchers moved into Mesilla, the governors of Chihuahua and New Mexico both claiming\r\njurisdiction over the area and threatening to send troops to enforce their claims of\r\nsovereignty.\r\n<br><img src="/mapimages/jamesgadsden.jpg" style="float:right;padding:0px 7px;">\r\nThe United States sent James Gadsden, <i>pictured</i>, to Mexico City in 1853 to try to resolve the\r\nconflict with instructions to seek the abrogation of Article 11 of the Treaty of Guadalupe\r\nHidalgo. The United States also charged Gadsden with normalizing trade relations\r\nbetween the two countries, and with gaining U.S. transit rights through the Isthmus of\r\nTehuántepec to facilitate the construction of a railroad linking the Atlantic and Pacific\r\nOceans, a project whose importance had increased significantly with the discovery of\r\ngold in California in 1848. U.S. threats to seize parts of northern Mexico militarily\r\nconvinced the Mexican authorities of the wisdom of agreeing to American demands. The\r\nUnited States gained all that it sought, including the mineral rich areas in southern New\r\nMexican territory. In return, the federal government promised to pay Mexico $10 million\r\nin compensation for the acquired territory and pledged mutual cooperation in suppressing\r\nfilibustering activity, but the U.S. Senate removed the article relating to the latter from\r\nthe treaty. Once again, the United States had won a considerable victory over Mexico.</p>	1853	1853	1	95	OPERATION GATEKEEPER THE RISE OF THE “ILLEGAL ALIEN” AND THE MAKING OF THE U.S.-MEXICO BOUNDARY by JOSEPH NEVINS	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:51.768356	2015-02-13 04:07:51.768356	\N

494	The Revolution is Televised	<p class="entry columns3"><i>\r\nUS-backed coup against the Chavez government fails after two days amidst huge street demonstrations.</i>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n&emsp;Beginning in late 2000, the National Assembly granted Chavez the special power to legislate by decree on a wide range of issues in order to bring national laws up to code with the new constitution. Within the year, the president decreed forty-nine law-decrees on a variety of issues, including regulation of the petroleum industry, mi­crofinancing, fishing and land reform. Among these were the new cooperative law that laid the foundation for Venezuela's cooperative explosion, with nearly 300,000 coops now registered by the national government, and a new Land Law that limited private land holdings, and authorized expropriations of fallow land, and its redistribution to organized campesinos.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;On February 4th, 2002, Chavez announced the Presidential Decree 1666 on urban land, opening the door to Venezuelan citi­zens living in the barrios to acquire the title to their homes. This encouraged Venezuelan communities to organize into Urban Land Committees in order to write their community charters and fight for the official deeds to their property.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;But while the law-decrees were empowering some sectors, they were frightening others, Chavez had won the 1998 presidency\r\nwith a large middle-class constituency, who now felt their interests threatened by the new laws and constitution. They foresaw further distribution of resources away from the traditional upper-middle classes in favor of the poor masses. The opposition began to grow and organize. Backed by the traditional oligarchy and the main­ stream media, they began to march daily against the new reforms.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Chavez supporters also took to the streets, organized through community networks known as the Bolivarian Circles. Venezuela's capital, Caracas, is surrounded by poor barrios, which house nearly half of its population of five million in sub-adequate housing and facilities. These people were seeing, for the first time in their lives, that they actually had a political say in the direction of the country.\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/carmonavencoup.jpg" style="max-width:320px;"><br>\r\n<span class="caption">Coup president Pedro Carmona swears himself into office on April 12, 2002</span><br>\r\n&emsp;On April 11, 2002, after rising tensions, a group of rebelling military officers staged a coup d'etat in conjunction with opposition leaders and the mainstream media. President Chavez was jailed and taken to a military base off the coast of Venezuela. Pedro Carmona, the head of Venezuela's elite business federation, FEDECANIARAS, was sworn in as de facto president, quickly abolishing the 1999 Constitution, disbanding the Congress, and installing a virtual media blackout.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;But Chavez supporters didn't give in. Less than two days after President Chavez was taken from office, pro-Chavez activists descended from the poor barrios around Caracas and the major cities, and surrounded Miraflores demanding that their president be returned to office. A few short hours later, he was rushed back to power.\r\n<img src="/mapimages/chavezreturn.jpg" style="max-width:320px;"><br>\r\n<span class="caption">Chavez's return</span><br>\r\n &emsp;Carmona and the coup plotters had underestimated the response of Chavez's supporters.

564	The Suffocating influence of United Fruit	http://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/pc/images/015.jpg\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="One Coup..."></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3"><span class="intro">U.S. military intervention in Guatemala during a period of fighting between trade unionists and the government. President Coolidge pressures Guatemala to overthrow President Carlos Herrera, enabling United Fruit to expand.</span>\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nNationalist currents proved even more unpredictable in Guatemala. The\r\nUnionists who overthrew Estrada Cabrera in 1920 had drawn support\r\nfrom a range of political reformers, labor leaders, and conservative\r\nelites. While their more radical plans were never realized, the Unionists\r\ninitiated a decade-long political opening in which the National Assembly\r\nand press remained relatively free from executive domination. At first,\r\nWashington seemed to accept this new order of things. In June 1920, the\r\nWilson administration recognized the new government, and in September\r\nit welcomed the victory of Provisional President Carlos Herrera in the\r\nfirst free election in Guatemalan history. But the Unionists’ rhetoric\r\nand policies soon rankled US. officials. Not only did nationalists in the\r\nassembly denounce Washington’s longstanding support of Estrada Cabrera,\r\nbut they also called for closer relations with Mexico and moved forward\r\nwith plans to form a Central American federation. In October 1921, just\r\nweeks after hosting a celebration of the centennial anniversary of Central\r\nAmerican independence, Herrera announced a union with El Salvador and\r\nHonduras-the two other nations that had ratified the Pact of San Jose.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThis democratic opening also allowed for the first public debates\r\nover United Fruit’s role in the country. Having initiated its operations in\r\nGuatemala during Estrada Cabrera’s rule, the firm had benefited tremendously from its ties to his regime. With the dictator gone, nationalists now\r\ncalled for a reining in of both United Fruit and Keith’s rail monopoly, the\r\nIRCA. Pressure came especially from planters and commercial interests\r\nwho demanded the IRCA end its distorted rate system, which continued\r\nto channel most of the nation’s commerce through Puerto Barrios. In the\r\nwaning days of the Wilson administration, some US. officials sympathized\r\nwith these grievances. Noting that the IRCA’s monopoly would never\r\nbe tolerated in the United States, one American diplomat declared, “<i>the\r\none reason which prevents the government from taking steps to better\r\nthe situation is the fear of the influence of the United Fruit Company in\r\nWashington.</i>"\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="...Then Another"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">&emsp;\r\nDespite his reluctance to confront United Fruit, Herrera could not ignore the rising currents of nationalism and labor militancy. One of his\r\nprincipal challenges was the Railroad Workers’ League, a union that was\r\ngrowing in strength despite the IRCA’s refusal to recognize it. By early\r\n1921, the league had purged its few remaining African American and West\r\nIndian members and allied itself with its counterpart in Mexico, a connection made easier by the fact that many of its members were Mexican. Soon\r\nafter, the union began calling on the Guatemalan government to curb the\r\nIRCA’s power and force the company to place Guatemalans in manage-\r\nrial positions." With the rail workers making effective use of nationalist\r\nrhetoric, Herrera felt increasingly compelled to confront the IRCA. In\r\nMay 1921, following a brief strike by the Railroad Workers’ League, he\r\ncanceled a 1908 concession that would have allowed the IRCA to extend a\r\nrail line to El Salvador. In response, Keith turned to Washington, where the\r\npro-corporate Harding administration took up his cause. Although some\r\nAmerican diplomats protested that Herrera remained friendly to US. business and adhered to “democratic principles,”Washington was adamant that\r\nhe restore the contract.The Guatemalan president refused to back down,\r\nhowever, and as Estrada Cabrera had done in 1914, he followed up his challenge to the IRCA by squeezing United Fruit’s labor supply. In October\r\n1921, with anti-American resentment building throughout the country,\r\nHerrera quadrupled the deposit required of black immigrants from $50 to\r\n$200 and made it retroactive to 1914. Fearing, quite rightly, that the new\r\nmeasure would chase West Indians from the country and thereby undercut\r\nits labor system, United Fruit once again requested support from the US.\r\ngovernment. In this case, however, American diplomats proved reluctant to\r\npressure Guatemala City, for the U.S. Congress itself had passed immigration restrictions the previous month. Nevertheless, the weakened Herrera\r\nfell to a military coup in December 1921.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nBoth the U.S. government and United Fruit initially welcomed the new\r\ngovernment headed by General José Maria Orellana. Despite noting with\r\nconcern that the new president was “certainly more than half Indian,” a\r\nspecial U.S. envoy declared him “stronger, more pro-American, and more\r\nhonest” than his predecessor." Over the following year, Washington helped\r\nOrellana shore up his regime, including offering assistance in the formation\r\nof a new Guatemalan constabulary. Part of a larger U.S. strategy beginning\r\nto take hold in the Hispanic Caribbean, this training of local security forces\r\naimed to secure order and project U.S. influence without the economic\r\nand political costs of overt intervention. As in other nations in the region,\r\nthe form this policy took hinged to a great extent on American perceptions\r\nof the local population, which were in turn rooted in U.S. imperial culture.\r\nSecurity forces “would require a different type of trained man in some of\r\nthe Republics from that which would be acceptable in some of the others,”\r\nexplained Major Fred T. Cruse, the U.S. military attache:\r\n<br>\r\n<span class="blockquote">\r\nI consider that officers of our Philippine Scouts or Philippine Constablary would be most suitable to organize the force in Guatemala, because\r\nthese officers have had experience in the Philippines dealing with divers[e]\r\nnative tribes, and that is what they would have to deal with in Guatemala.“</span>\r\n<br>\r\nFor their part, United Fruit managers hoped Orellana, a close associate\r\nof former president Manuel Estrada Cabrera, would prove friendlier to\r\ntheir interests and labor needs. But they were quickly disappointed.\r\nAlthough the new president annulled the Unionist constitution and with-\r\ndrew from the federation with El Salvador and Honduras, he made no\r\nattempt to coerce the legislature or curb what one US. official described\r\nas Guatemala’s “excessive” freedom of the press.SI And while Orellana\r\nhoped to repair relations with United Fruit, he understood that his political survival hinged to a great extent on his willingness to address nationalist concerns. Despite fierce pressure from Washington and United Fruit, he\r\nrefused to restore the IRCA’S contract, and he maintained strict enforce-\r\nment of the deposit requirement on black immigrants. Such policies set the\r\nstage for another bitter strike in Puerto Barrios.	1920	1920	1	89	The Business of Empire: United Fruit, Race, and U.S. Expansion in Central America by Jason Colby	large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:51.743361	2015-02-13 04:07:51.743361	\N

563	The Evart Doctrine	<p class="entry columns" style="color:white;">In 1920, President Coolidge announces Evart Doctrine to justify U.S. intervention in internal affairs of Latin America in order to protect U.S. foreign holdings. President Coolidge was of the view that the person and property of a citizen are part of the general domain of the nation, i.e. the US nation, even when abroad. This thesis formed the basis of the Evart Doctrine,which claimed legal immunity for US citizens and their business activities in Latin America, in violation of the national sovereignty of the affected countries. This overarching position of the US government provided another modality of justification for interventionism in Latin America, and was a continuing source of friction in US-Latin American relations.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr style="height:2px; color:#cc0000; width: 60%;visibility:visible;">\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="color:white;font-size:small;padding:10px;padding-top:128px;">\r\nThe US was now a financially powerful nation&#8212;so powerful  that it was able to buy the Caribbean Islands of St. Thomas and St. \r\nCroix from Denmark in 1917. Those were the days when for the  first time the US dollar was badly needed for effective world trade. \r\nPushed on by Presidents Taft and Wilson, the dollar became a  diplomat. The period of "dollar diplomacy" defined by President \r\nTaft as a "policy... characterized as substituting dollars for bullets"  was ushered in. It was the logical amplification to the Monroe Doctrine in the era of the expat of capital for the exclusion of competitors and the staking out of hegemonistic claims; earlier, in the \r\nera of export of goods, there was the "open door" demand for  "equal rights" in Asia and the Arab world. \r\n<br>\r\nFinancial investment in the form of loans and the establishment \r\nof branch plants replaced trade as the main vehicle for penetration \r\nand profit-making in Latin America and the Caribbean. US \r\nbanking interests succeeded in wresting dominance in the bond and \r\nloan markets. And US investments increased from 17 per cent of all \r\ninvestments in Latin America in 1914 (second only to Britain) to \r\n40 per cent in 1929. U.S. direct investments, the bulk of which were \r\nmade in mining, agriculture, railways and petroleum, increased \r\nfrom $ 1.6 billion in 1914 to $3.5 billion in 1929. In 1913, Cuba(second to Mexico) and the Caribbean accounted for 20 per cent of \r\ndirect investment capital in Latin America." \r\n<br>\r\nAnd in this era of dollar diplomacy, foreign investment was \r\ngiven protection under the Evart doctrine, which stated that "the \r\nperson and property of a citizen are part of the general domain of \r\nthe nation, even when abroad". President Coolidge had pointed \r\nout that "there was a distinct and binding obligation on the part of \r\nself-respecting governments to afford protection to the persons and \r\nproperty of their citizens, wherever they may be."\r\n<br>\r\nSerious opposition-developed against the interventionist policies \r\nand practices of the "Colossus of the North" even to Woodrow \r\nWilson's indirect method of withholding recognition of revolutionary governments. A meeting of the Inter-American commission of \r\nJurists in Rio de Janeiro in 1927 resolved that "no state can interfere in the internal affairs of another". However, that principle \r\nwas not accepted by the Sixth International Conference of \r\nAmerican States in Havana in 1928. Under strong US proding in \r\nan atmosphere tailor-made for imperialistic arm-twisting, it was \r\ndecided to review the question of intervention at the next (seventh) \r\nconference: the Peruvian delegate, supported by others, had \r\nproposed a resolution which called on all countries to recognise the independence of each state, and that no control or intervention by  another should be tolerated.<br>\r\n<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 10px; font-family: helvetica, sans-serif; text-transform: uppercase;">The Caribbean: Whose backyard? by Cheddi Jagan</span>\r\n</p>	1920	1920	1	106	Geopolitics and the Post-colonial by David Slater	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:51.832683	2015-02-13 04:07:51.832683	\N

566	The Temporary Quota Act of 1921	<p class="entry columns3" style="margin-top:-5px;">The outbreak of World War I led the U.S. government to implement travel restrictions and to deploy troops along the boundary. This led to a decrease in\r\nunauthorized immigration and in illegal activity in the border region during the\r\nWar years of 1917–1918, despite the passage of additional restrictionist\r\nimmigration legislation in 1917 that, under normal circumstances, would have led to an\r\nincrease in unauthorized immigration as immigrants who would have previously gained\r\nlegal access to the United States would have had to have resorted to clandestine methods\r\nto enter. Yet the increased demands on boundary enforcement officials brought about by\r\nthe war (including the inspection of all peoples crossing from the United States into\r\nMexico) overwhelmed the authorities. It was during this time that discussions to establish\r\na permanent patrol force along the U.S.-Mexico boundary began. Thus, the roots of the\r\nU.S. Border Patrol are to be found not only in concerns about unauthorized immigration,\r\nbut also (and perhaps more so) in a preoccupation with matters of national security as\r\nrelated to the boundary.\r\n<br>\r\nUnauthorized entries picked up quickly following the end of the war and intensified as\r\nCongress placed additional restrictions on immigration. As a result, pressures for the\r\nBureau of Immigration to increase its efforts to fight illegal boundary activity grew. The\r\nbureau’s commissioner-general stressed in 1919 that such efforts were needed in the face\r\nof large numbers of apprehensions (seeming to suggest that many more were entering\r\nsuccessfully) of unauthorized European and Chinese immigrants smuggled in from\r\nCanada, Mexico, and Cuba. In the case of Cuba, reports in 1922 stated that there were\r\nmore than 30,000 unemployed Chinese immigrants on the island who soon intended to\r\nattempt to enter the United States. In the aftermath of the destruction of World War I,\r\nthere was also widespread fear that huge numbers of immigrants from Europe might try\r\nto enter the United States extralegally. Indeed, the number of entries into the United\r\nStates in 1920 was 300 percent that of the previous year. Such factors led to the passage\r\nof the temporary Quota Act of 1921, limiting the number of admissions of any one\r\nparticular nationality to three percent of the group’s population already in the United\r\nStates as reflected by the 1910 census. This marked the first quantitative immigration\r\nrestriction in U.S. history. The Immigration Act of 1924 made these quotas permanent,\r\nbut used the census of 1890 as its base. The act also required immigrants for the first time\r\nto obtain visas from U.S. consular officials abroad before traveling to the United States.\r\nThese restrictions had unintended consequences, leading to a rapid rise in the number of\r\nunauthorized European immigrants who would enter from Canada or Mexico, countries\r\nnot subject to quantitative immigration restrictions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\nAn economic recession in the aftermath of World War I facilitated hysterical nativist\r\nattacks against immigrants, especially Mexicans. As Wayne Cornelius notes, “Urged on\r\nby labor leaders and politicians, mobs of native-born Americans in Texas, Oklahoma, and\r\nother states launched attacks on Mexicans in their work places; vigilante groups\r\nterrorized them in their homes and destroyed their property.” Between 1920 and 1921,\r\nalmost 100,000 Mexicans left the United States “under varying degrees of coercion.”\r\nMany were U.S.-born Mexican Americans.\r\n\r\n</p>	1921	1921	1	107	Operation Gatekeeper by Joseph Nevins	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:51.848508	2015-02-13 04:07:51.848508	\N

Though the PR was a shell of\r\nits former self, its activists deeply compromised\r\nwith the counterrevolution, the party of Arevalo\r\nand Arbenz still held shreds of legitimacy\r\namong the electorate, 43.7% of whom abstained\r\nanyway."\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nDespite the obstacles strewn in his path by the\r\narmed forces, PR candidate Mendez Montenegro\r\nran out winner, presenting himself demagogically\r\nas head of the "Third Government of\r\nthe Revolution." By this time, the Army was in\r\ndeep trouble against the guerrillas. Though\r\nMendez looked a model Alliance for Progress-style\r\ncandidate, the Pentagon opposed his election.\r\nThe dilemma between military imperatives\r\nand reformist rhetoric was swiftly resolved:\r\nMendez would take office, but not real power&#8212;\r\nthat would go to the military. With a\r\nU.S.-mediated military-civilian pact in its\r\npocket, Washington insisted that the armed\r\nforces respect the election results.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nMendez invited U.S. military advisers into\r\nGuatemala the day after his inauguration, entrusting\r\nto them a counterinsurgency campaign\r\ncrafted with the heady confidence of a pre-Tet\r\noffensive Vietnam. In the eastern mountains,\r\noperations under Col. Carlos Arana Osorio,\r\nknown as the "Butcher of Zacapa," virtually\r\nwiped out the guerrillas and claimed 8,000\r\npeasant lives in two years. In that savagely\r\npolarized region, the MLN was the only established\r\nright-wing force. Many peasants were\r\nnervous about the guerrilla advance, and the\r\nMLN's aggressive recruitment campaign, in\r\nwhich no neutrals were allowed, brought the\r\nparty broad support and potential for a genuinely\r\nmass-based fascist movement.\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/guatamalaexhumation.jpg">\r\n<span class="caption">In 2004, a crowd watches the exhumation of a mass grave in Comalapa.

Hardly. A\r\nmajor debate hinged on the overhaul of Guatemala's\r\ntax system, one of the most regressive in\r\nthe world. (Central government revenues averaged\r\na mere 9% of the gross domestic product.)\r\nBowing to private sector pressure, which denounced\r\nthe fiscal proposals as "communist,"\r\nMendez sacked his progressive finance minister,\r\nAlberto Fuentes Mohr.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAgain, U.S. influence at a crucial juncture\r\nwas decisive. Liberal AID and State Department\r\nofficials were appalled by right-wing intransigence\r\nand the excesses of counterinsurgency,\r\nbut backed down when confronted by\r\nthe hostility of the local U.S. business community,\r\nspearheaded by the luminaries of the\r\nAmerican Chamber of Commerce. This retreat\r\nconvinced the private sector that its intransigence\r\ncould always count on Washington's\r\nblessings.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nU.S. strategic allies&#8212;local military men and\r\nexporters in partnership with unscrupulous\r\nCuban exiles and Sunbelt investors who flooded\r\ninto Guatemala in the 1960s&#8212;saw no political\r\nor economic logic in moderation. The Central\r\nAmerican Common Market (CACM) accepted\r\nGuatemala as its base of operations, tied to the\r\ndemands of world markets; what need was there\r\nto create a domestic consumer market through\r\nreforms?

In the aftermath of a\r\nmassive deportation and repatriation campaign of people of Mexican origin from the\r\nUnited States in the 1930s, the Border Patrol grew considerably. The outbreak of World\r\nWar II caused great consternation within the administration of Franklin Delano\r\nRoosevelt, which feared that foreign agents with anti-American intentions would attempt\r\nto enter the United States clandestinely. The administration played an important role in\r\nconstructing immigration and border enforcement as issues of national security. As a\r\nresult, the administration transferred the Immigration and Naturalization Service from the\r\nDepartment of Labor to the Department of Justice. (President Hoover had consolidated\r\nthe Bureau of Immigration and the Bureau of Naturalization into the INS in 1933.) Two\r\nweeks later, Congress appropriated two million dollars to add 712 Border Patrol officers\r\n(almost doubling the size of the force), 57 auxiliary personnel, and the needed\r\nequipment. The Border Patrol carried out many functions during the war, including\r\nguarding “enemy alien” detention camps and diplomats as well as helping the U.S.\r\nmilitary guard the country’s east coast against the potential entry of agents from the Axis\r\npowers.</p>	1940	1940	1	74	OPERATION GATEKEEPER by JOSEPH NEVINS	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:51.921979	2015-02-13 04:07:51.921979	\N

606	What's mine is not a sacrifice but a duty I hope to have fulfilled.	<p class="entries columns">\r\n\r\n<strong>1956</strong> <i>Anastasio Somoza Garcia is assassinated by a twenty-six-year-old Nicaraguan poet Rigoberto Lopez Perez.</i><br> In his last letter to his mother, Rigoberto writes:\r\n<br>\r\n<span style="margin-left: 20px;"><i>&quot;[S]eeing that all efforts to return Nicaragua to being (or to becoming for the first time) a free country without shame or stain have been futile, I have decided that I should be the one to try to initiate the beginning of the end of this tyranny.&quot;</i> \r\n</span><br><span style="margin-left: 20px;">\r\nA few days later in his hometown of Leon, he publicly assassinated Anastasio Somoza. He was himself immediately killed, receiving thirty-five bullet wounds. As we know, he did in fact &quot;initiate the beginning of the end&quot; of that tyranny. Rigoberto tried to console his mother by denying that his act was a sacrifice: &quot;I hope that you will take this calmly. You must understand that my act is a duty that any Nicaraguan would desire to be done for his country . . . not a sacrifice, but a duty that I want to fulfill.&quot; \r\n<br>In 1972, Carlos Fonseca Amador, founder and leader of the FSLN, published in Cuba an essay entitled &quot;Notes on the Testimonial Letter of Rigoberto Lopez Perez,&quot; which concluded: &quot;no epistle by an evangelist . . . no decalogue by a hero or treatise on virtue contains more ethical richness than the words of Rigoberto Lopez Perez to his mother, affirmed with his lifeblood&quot;. \r\n</span><br><span style="margin-left: 20px;">The themes of Rigoberto’s letter have become almost mythic in Nicaragua — the son or daughter who gives his or her life, but not as a sacrifice; the young revolutionary who wins the support of his or her mother, and often her cooperation, in revolutionary struggle; the dignity of duty, deﬁned as working for the liberation of one’s people; the ideal of the &quot;new person,&quot; drawn from Cuba’s revolution; the revolutionary motivated by feelings of great love (as Che expressed it), who overcomes egoism and fear and commits his or her life to creating a new society. For many in Nicaragua these themes have come alive in their revolution, giving it deep spiritual meaning. Christians see love of one’s neighbor put into practice. Jesus becomes a model for revolutionary Nicaraguans alongside Che Guevara. \r\n\r\n</span><br><span style="margin-left: 20px;">Somoza&rsquo;s killer, Rigoberto L&oacute;pez P&eacute;rez, was slain on the spot by presidential bodyguards. A twenty-seven-year-old poet, L&oacute;pez P&eacute;rez had loose ties to the dissident PLI, and he had been trained and armed by anti-Somoza former National Guardsmen who lived in exile in El Salvador. Sixteen years later, in his &lsquo;&lsquo;Notes on the \r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/rigobertolopezperez.png" class="floatleft">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTestimonial Letter of Rigoberto L&oacute;pez P&eacute;rez,&rsquo;&rsquo; Fonseca described L&oacute;pez P&eacute;rez as a &lsquo;&lsquo;legitimate child of Sandino,&rsquo;&rsquo; characterizing his action as &lsquo;&lsquo;not just understandable but also justifiable&rsquo;&rsquo; because &lsquo;&lsquo;in the whole country there was no organization, no leadership, no revolutionary consciousness." Fonseca had no praise for L&oacute;pez P&eacute;rez in 1956, however, when he was still committed to nonviolent methods and believed that the PSN provided the leadership Nicaragua needed. \r\n</span><br><span style="margin-left: 20px;">\r\nSomoza's eldest son, Luis Somoza Debayle, becomes president. President Luis Somoza declared a state of siege after his father&rsquo;s killing and began a roundup of suspected conspirators that was particularly intense in Le&oacute;n. The area surrounding the university was turned into an armed camp, its streets blocked by barbed wire and patrolled by the National Guard. Hundreds of students and other dissidents were arrested, including Carlos Fonseca, who had never met L&oacute;pez P&eacute;rez and knew nothing about the assassination plot. Held from September 27 to November 14, Carlos was eventually released without charges, probably as a result of his father&rsquo;s intervention. Tom&aacute;s Borge remained in jail more than two years, winning release only after sustained student protests. </span><br><span style="margin-left: 20px;"> Luis Somoza Debayle rules until he dies of a heart attack in 1967.</span</p>	1956	1956	7	57	The Best of what We are: Reflections on the Nicaraguan Revolution By John Brentlinger and SANDINISTA: Carlos Fonseca and the Nicaraguan Revolution by MATILDE ZIMMERMANN	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:52.073881	2015-02-13 04:07:52.073881	\N
587	The United States advises General Martinez to resign.	<p class="columns bigquote">\r\nThe espousal of the Atlantic Charter and Roosevelt's four freedoms by Central America's caudillos appeared at odds with the policies of domestic political repression. It is doubtful if this argument on its own could have accounted for the events which unfolded in Central America in 1944, but combined with weak political representation of the professional class and an economic decline during the years of World War 2, it added up to a powerful case for political change.\r\n<br>\r\nDiscontent began to surface in 1943 with unsuccessful military revolts in Honduras and El Salvador. In April 1944, another military coup was attempted in El Salvador and failed, but the repression which followed unleashed a strike by students which was taken up by the whole of San Salvador. Nervous about popular unrest in El Salvador, the United States advises General Martinez to resign. By mid-May, Martinez had resigned, following the advice of the US ambassador, and his resignation sent a tremor through the neighboring republics, though Military rule continues in El Salvador. In the next four months, there were student strikes and urban protests throughout Central America. In Honduras and Nicaragua, the protests were crushed, but the movements did produce new political parties; in Guatemala, however, a general strike achieved the resignation of Ubico, following a protest by students and teachers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	1944	1944	1	40	The Political Economy of Central America Since 1920  By V.

Its formal title in English is the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance and, in Spanish, Tratado Interamericano de Asistencia Rec&iacute;proca. Since then, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Trinidad and Tobago and the Bahamas have adhered to the Treaty, but Cuba withdrew on March 29, 1960, and Mexico gave notice in 2002 of its intention to do so also. By Article 3 of the Treaty the signatories "agree that an armed attack by any states against an American state shall be considered as an attack against all the American states", and consequently "undertake to assist in meeting the attack in exercise of the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the UN Charter." The procedure for doing so is that "on the request of the state or states directly attacked and until the decision of the organ of consultation of the inter-American system," each of the signatories "may determine immediate measure which it may individually adopt in fulfillment of the obligation contained in the preceding paragraph and in accordance with the principle of continental solidarity. The organ of consultation shall meet without delay for the purpose of examining these measures and agreeing upon measures of a collective character that should be adopted." The Treaty was invoked on 14 occasions between 1948 and 1962; it has only been invoked once since, by the USA in 2001.</p>	1947	1947	1	19	<span style="color:white;">Dollars and Dictators: A Guide to Central America<br> by Tom Barry, Beth Wood, and Deb Preusch <br>and A Political and Economic Dictionary<br> of Latin America  By Peter Calvert</span>	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:51.971437	2015-02-13 04:07:51.971437	\N

595	The rise of Jorge Gaitan	Since the late 1840s the Conservative and Liberal parties have dominated Colombian politics. The Conservative Party has historically aligned with and represented the interests of the large landholding oligarchy and the Catholic Church. The Liberal Party, on the other hand, has been more closely aligned with Colombia&rsquo;s commercial sector and tended to view the Catholic Church as a backward social institution that prevented economic modernization. Although for many years their policy programmes were largely indistinguishable, the rise of Jorge Gaitan, a left-wing Liberal Party member during the 1940s, managed to reorient the Liberal Party towards a more reformist and egalitarian agenda that sought modest land reforms and progressive labour laws. Gaitan&rsquo;s populism was based on his appeal to the poor and dispossessed throughout Colombia; in the words of Jenny Pearce, he sought to make &lsquo;capitalism socially responsible, not to abolish it&rsquo;.38 Gaitan took over the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1947, and was almost certain to win elections scheduled for 1950.	1947	1947	6	30		medium	f	2015-02-13 04:07:51.990119	2015-02-13 04:07:51.990119	\N
596	The Killing of Gaitan, the Bogotazo, and La Violencia	Jorge Gaitan’s increasingly populist appeal, combined with his overt rhetoric attacking the unequal distribution of national resources, made Colombia’s ruling class, and especially the large landowners aligned with the Conservative Party, increasingly worried and hostile. Gaitan was subsequently assassinated in Bogotá (Colombia’s capital city) in 1948. His assassination ended the democratic challenge to oligarchic rule in Colombia, and destroyed the hopes of the poor majority that he represented. His death also ‘ruptured the breakwaters holding back years of discontent’ and the immediate response to his assassination was a spontaneous popular uprising in Bogotá that destroyed established symbols of power and privilege. The Colombian military put down the uprising but the violence spread to Colombia’s rural areas and sparked a large-scale civil war within Colombia now known as <i>la violencia</i>. <br> <i>Galeano Now</i>: When he was shot dead, the hurricane was unleashed. First the spontaneous bogotazo&#8212;an uncontrollable human tide in the streets of the capital; then the violence spread to the countryside, where bands organized by the Conservatives had for some time been sowing terror. The bitter taste of hatred, long in the peasants' mouths, provoked an explosion; the government sent police and soldiers to cut off testicles, slash pregnant women’s bellies, and&#8212;throw babies in the air to catch on bayonet points--the order of the day being "don't leave even the seed." Liberal Party sages shut themselves in their homes, never abandoning their good manners and the gentlemanly tone of their manifestos, or went into exile abroad. It was a war of incredible cruelty and it became worse as it went on, feeding the lust for vengeance. New ways of killing came into vogue: the <i>corte corbata</i>, for example, left the tongue hanging from the neck. Rape, arson, and plunder went on and on; people were quartered or burned alive, skinned or slowly cut in pieces; troops razed villages and plantations and rivers ran red with blood. Bandits spared lives in exchange for tribute, in money or loads of coffee, and the repressive forces expelled and pursued innumerable families, who fled to seek refuge in the mountains. Women gave birth in the woods. The first guerrilla leaders, determined to take revenge but without clear political vision, took to destroying for destruction's sake, letting off blood and steam without purpose.	1948	1949	10	\N		medium	f	2015-02-13 04:07:51.997272	2015-02-13 04:07:51.997272	\N

600	Inter-American Regional Organization of Workers Forms	Inter-American Regional Organization of Workers (ORIT) forms with backing of U.S. Department of State. Originally based in Mexico, the ORIT was been created within the framework of Cold War politics with the aim of &quot;resisting communist influence&quot; in Latin America. When it was based in Cuba in the early 1950s, ORIT first opposed the 1953 military coup that brought dictator Fulgencio Batista to power, then accommodated itself to his brutal regime. When the Castro-led revolution prevailed in 1959, ORIT ﬂed to Mexico City to set up its new headquarters and chose one of Batista’s former cabinet members as an assistant to ORIT’s general secretary.’ It was common knowledge among Latin American unionists that ORIT fronted for the CIA. As one US State Department official put it,“ORIT was bought and paid for by Uncle Sam.” <br> Philip Agee, the former CIA agent and whistleblower, fingered ORIT as &quot;a principal mechanism for CIA labor operations in Latin America&quot; Its purpose, said Agee, was to subvert radical Latin American unions and help the CIA &quot;divide the victims and neutralize their leaders.&quot; One could hardly miss the CIA connections. Agee reported that, as of 1963, several ORIT bosses&#8212;its secretary-general and assistant secretary-general&#8212;were CIA agents.  <BR> The CIA apparently viewed ORIT as incompetent. Agee, in a 1960 diary entry, wrote: &quot;Officers in the WH Division [the CIA’s Western Hemisphere Division] were practically unanimous in condemning ORIT. . . . They said ORIT is hopeless, discredited and completely ineffective for attracting non-communist labor organizations in Latin America.&quot; 	1951	1951	5	53	The Man Who Hated Work and Loved Labor: The Life and Times of Tony Mazzocchi By Les Leopold	medium	f	2015-02-13 04:07:52.025266	2015-02-13 04:07:52.025266	\N

598	Mutual Security Act	1951 U.S. Congress passes Mutual Security Act, which makes funds available to strengthen Latin American armies for hemispheric defense.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThe legal foundations for the new system of military and police collaboration among nation-states were set by the U.S. Congress over a period of just four years, starting in , when it gave President Truman the authority to help the governments of Greece and Turkey to defend themselves from communists. It was the first time that military collaboration became a paramount peacetime foreign policy tool. Two years later, Truman asked Congress to go a step further and authorize “military aid to free nations to enable them to protect themselves against the threat of aggression.” The result was the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of  October , the law upon which all subsequent military collaboration programs, including government grants of equipment and training services as well as cash sales and credit sales, were founded.14 It authorized the conveyance, “without payment to the United States,” of “military assistance in the form of equipment, materials, and services” and it defined equipment and materials as “any arms, ammunition or implements of war, or any other type of material, article, raw material, facility, tool, machine, supply, or item that would further the purposes of this Act, or any component or part thereof, used or required for use in connection therewith, or required in or for the manufacture, production, processing, storage, transportation, repair, or rehabilitation of any equipment or materials, but shall not include merchant vessels.” Services included “any service, repair, training of personnel, or technical or other assistance or information necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Act.”15\r\nAlthough the act only authorized gifts of military assistance through the Military Assistance Program (MAP) to member states of NATO plus Iran, Korea, and the Philippines, it permitted the president to sell military equipment, materials, and services to any other country that may have joined the United States in a “collective defense and regional arrangement,” but only so long as such a country paid the full cost of the transfers in advance. The latter was called the “408-e” program.16 Within a year, however, as a result of both the widening conflict over Korea and the success of the communist revolution in China, Asia suddenly emerged as a military-collab-oration priority, radically expanding the potential geographical scope of collaboration and calling for new legislation to replace that of 1949. The result was the Mutual Security Act of 10 October 1951, in which Congress expanded the number of countries for which assistance was authorized. This act also authorized grant collaboration with Latin America for the first time, but in doing so Congress added a restriction that would become increasingly controversial before it was finally abandoned by about 1961. Grant collaboration could be authorized “only in accordance with defense plans which are found by the President to require the recipient country to participate in missions important to the defense of the Western Hemisphere,” and under the terms of bilateral agreements “designed to assure that the assistance will be used to promote the defense of the Western Hemisphere.”17 In other words, grant collaboration to protect Latin American government from internal enemies was prohibited. Grant collaboration could only be undertaken to defend Latin America\r\n\r\nagainst an attack from outside the hemisphere. If the fear of a Soviet attack on Latin America was a paranoid fantasy, it is well to recall that it was one that gripped the United States itself in the first years of the Cold War. In 1950, Congress created the Army Antiaircraft Command, which hastily installed gun defenses against a Soviet air attack across the United States over the next six years, when Nike missiles began replacing the guns. By 1963, 219 surface-to-air missile batteries were defending the United States against Soviet bombers.\r\n\r\n\r\n--!>	1951	1951	1	106		medium	f	2015-02-13 04:07:52.062513	2015-02-13 04:07:52.062513	\N
607	The Office of Public Safety, Anything but.	<div class="page" data-title="The Office of Public Safety"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns"><img src="/mapimages/opseisenhower.jpg" class="floatright">\r\n&emsp;President Eisenhower establishes Office of Public Safety (OPS) to train Latin American police.<br> From the early 1960s until the mid 1970s, the US Office of Public Safety (part of AID), operated The International Police Academy, at first in Panama, then in Washington. It did for foreign police officers what the SOA did for the military. OPS provided training abroad for more than a million policemen in the Third World, ten thousand of whom were selected to come to Washington for advanced training. There may well have been more serious human-rights abusers amongst the OPS police students than amongst the SOA military graduates because of the former's closer and more frequent contact with the populace. Moreover, most of the classes were held abroad, where the instructors could feel less constrained than in Washington or Georgia about lecturing in a very militant manner on &quot;the communist menace&quot; and the use of any means necessary to combat it. <span style="background-color:black;color:white;"> Amongst the means sometimes taught was torture. </span>\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOPS provided the police with weapons, ammunition, radios, patrol cars, tear gas, gas masks, batons and other crowd control devices; a class on Assassination Weapons—&quot;A discussion of various weapons which may be used by the assassin&quot; is how OPS put it; and instruction on the design, manufacture and employment of bombs and incendiary devices, taught at the &quot;bomb school&quot; in Los Fresnos, Texas.<span style="background-color:black;color:white;"> The official OPS explanation for the bomb courses was that policemen needed such training in order to deal with bombs placed by terrorists. There was, however, no instruction in destroying bombs, only in making them. </span><br> When Congress abolished the Public Safety Program in 1975 in response to rising criticism of this dark side of American foreign policy, the Drug Enforcement Administration, with help from the FBI and the Defense Department, quietly stepped in and continued the program. In various reincarnations, the program continues, just as the School of the Americas made it to the 21st century.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Its Predecessor"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\n&emsp;By 1957, five different U.S. government agencies—State, Defense, the International Cooperation Administration (ICA—the predecessor of the Agency for International Development), the Central Intelligence Agency, and the U.S. Information Agency—were collaborating with foreign governments in the realm of “internal security.” To coordinate their efforts, the Eisenhower administration created the Overseas Internal Security Program (OISP). The Defense Department was supposed to provide training, arms, ammunition, and equipment to “police forces operating under foreign defense establishments,” as well as training and equipping both paramilitary and military forces “for counter-intelligence and anti-guerrilla operations.” The ICA targeted civil police agencies, supplying equipment, training, and advice under what was alternately called the Public Safety Program or the “1290(d) program” after the number assigned to one of the National Security Council’s 1954 decisions. In December 1956, the only Latin American country with an ICA-run program was Guatemala, one of ten in the world. The ICA supported the “operation of country-wide communications networks, maintenance of national personal registration and identification systems, fire fighting and fire prevention, prison administration, control of customs, control of immigration, control of activities of foreigners, coast guard functions, domestic counter-intelligence and control of subversive activities, border control,” and even regulatory activities.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;The CIA’s early participation in police collaboration programs was broadened in March 1955, when it agreed to contribute to the ICA programs “a small highly trained nucleus of counter subversive specialists who would be supported by the larger conventional components” of the police program. The CIA’s role in covert aspects of police training expanded rapidly, as suggested by the decision of the Operations Coordinating Board (OCB) in September 1956 to place the operation of the 1290-d program under the control of a “Senior Group” headed by a “Senior Official” with access “to the covert aspects of this program on a need-to-know basis consistent with the operational security considerations involved.” By March 1961, the CIA had thirty-three employees “integrated into ICA Public Safety programs in twelve countries and is conducting parallel activities in other countries in support of OISP objectives.” Robert Amory, Jr., whose tenure as deputy director of the CIA from 1957 to 1962 spanned the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, told an interviewer in 1966 that the CIA became the “brains” of police collaboration. From the start, the CIA was active in\r\n<span class="blockquote" style="font-style:italic;">\r\nhelping develop internal police forces, which is a dangerous ground because you can get to Gestapo type tactics and so on and so forth, but essentially bringing to bear good police methods—good filing systems, good fingerprinting systems, good systems of riot control such as using dye so when you get the ring leaders, they can’t wash the dye off their clothes, without having a riot squad that picks up a lot of innocent people who just happen to be caught on a street corner. They worked very closely with AID on this. It’s a program called 1290D which could be a very good subject of a, you know, Ph.D. monograph sometime—which involved who was responsible in this police thing, and it fell back and forth between AID and CIA. Finally, under [Robert] Bob Komer’s leadership on the White House Staff, a task force was set up under Alexis Johnson. I happened to sit on it, and we solved the problem in a rather rude, but practical fashion of saying, “By God, AID will be responsible for it, but the brains are in CIA, so we’ll move those brains over to AID.” So we just took the CIA men—I can’t think of his name now [Byron Engle]—and gave them the mission of training police forces using American police forces occasionally as sort of sponsors, using Michigan State University School of Police Work, which is the best in the country, and a lot of excellent work has been done there.</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n	1957	1957	1	74	Rogue State: A Guide to the World's Only Superpower by William Blum <br> AND Armies without Nations: Public Violence and State Formation in <br> Central America, 1821–1960 by ROBERT H.

612	Panama Canal Zone becomes a key center for training in counterinsurgency.	<p class="columns" style="float: left; width:730px;" >\r\n<img src="/mapimages/Yarborough-With-Kennedy-ps.jpg"  style="max-width:50%;" class="floatleft">\r\nAfter the Cuban revolution, President John F. Kennedy (1961–63) created the Special Forces (Green Berets) and demanded that the U.S. Army reorganize to fight political-military wars. Kennedy ordered an ambitious new two-pronged security policy for Latin America: the Alliance for Progress, to foster social development in the region, and counterinsurgency programs, to prevent and contain revolution. The structural changes required for socioeconomic reform in Latin America were resisted, however, by the very elites and military forces strengthened by the counterinsurgency strategy. After Kennedy’s assassination, under the Mann doctrine, the counterinsurgency half of the strategy came to dominate the U.S. approach to the region.\r\n<br>\r\nIn 1960, the U.S. commander-in-chief of SOUTHCOM, Major T.F.Bogart, initiated the Conference of American Armies, a hemispheric security organization dominated by the United States and its organizational and ideological doctrines. U.S. military officers played a prominent role in these conferences. SOUTHCOM hosted the first, at Fort Amador in the Panama Canal Zone, where commanders from seventeen armies discussed specific accords to guide and regulate future combined activities. The yearly conferences, secret sessions that excluded civilians, provided a means for the Latin American armies, under U.S. tutelage, to form coordinated strategies—with no civilian input or control—and solidify an anticommunist front in the Americas.\r\n<br>\r\nPartially through the vehicle of these conferences, the countersubversive security doctrine was developed and expanded, and the inter-American defense system reorganized to deal with the perceived subversive threat in the Americas.\r\n<br>\r\nThe second of the secret articles forming the charter of the Conference of American Armies stated that the mission of the armies was “to protect the continent from the aggressive action of the International Communist Movement,” a movement that instigated internal subversion. In the conferences planning, intelligence sharing, and strategizing overwhelmingly emphasized the subversive threat. According to a 1985 history of the conferences, early meetings in the 1960s focused on the creation of a continental doctrine to fight “communist aggression”; the interchange of intelligence about subversive groups and international communism; the establishment of a permanent inter-American intelligence committee, located in the Panama Canal Zone; the setting up of schools of intelligence in each country; the creation of a system of encoded telecommunications among the armies; and programs of training for all the armies in strategies of countersubversion, counterrevolution, and internal security. Operation Condor, which was organized later, was clearly an outgrowth of these transnational structures and programs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style="background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;width:250px; margin-left: 760px">\r\n“ … It’s very rare that an element of the [U.S.] armed forces gets singled out by a president like that, and so this is a special thing to honor and I was glad to be part of it … both my alma maters, if you will, the [Army] Special Forces and the CIA [Central Inteligence Agency], both grew out of the [World War II] OSS [Office of Strategic Services] tradition and share that heritage today. But it really wasn’t until the 1960s with President Kennedy that [we saw] one of the periods of great growth in Special Forces, and it really put us on a path that we remain on to this day. There really is a lot of continuity in it. Missions have changed a little bit, and tactics have changed, but the path that was set forward in the early 1960s really remains with us today.” &#8212;Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael G.

The problem lay in their inability\r\nto do so mostly due to their main allegiance to the elite class, whom they also\r\nfailed to fully satisfy. Instead of seeking to alleviate the poor conditions of the\r\nmajority of the country, they relied on the tried and true method of throwing\r\nthe proverbial bone down the socioeconomic ladder hoping to placate\r\nthe sentiments of those who had supported revolutionary radicalism in the\r\npast. The military sought out people who would maintain their authority\r\nacross the country. In the place of creating programs that responded to the\r\nproblems of the rural poor population, the military sought the support of\r\nsquads that protected the oligarchy through the use of violence and intimidation,\r\nthus resulting in groups such as the Democratic Nationalist Organization\r\n(ORDEN).\r\n</td><td>\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/framemedrano.jpg">\r\n</td><td width=300px>\r\nThe Christian Democratic Party (PDC) gained considerable ground throughout the 1960s.\r\nDuarte was elected mayor of the capital in 1964 and served three consecutive\r\nterms until 1970 when he began preparing for a presidential bid for the 1972\r\nelections.

This represented an\r\never growing danger to the power of the PCN, who had won the presidency\r\nof 1967 with Colonel Fidel Sanchez Hernandez (1967–1972). Sanchez ordered\r\nthe National Guard to crack down on political and labor dissent. The Guard’s\r\nnew head was Colonel Jose Alberto Medrano, <i>pictured</i>, an officer who acquired funds\r\nto increase the activities of ORDEN, which was used both for public service\r\nand to spy on, intimidate, and liquidate the opposition, namely in the countryside.\r\nIt was during this period that U.S. military assistance expanded, with\r\nthe mindset that any dissent against the government must be illegitimate.

The Kennedy administration's Alliance for Progress and the establishment of a Central American Common Market (CACM) in the early 1960s initiated a period of highly capital intensive industrialization in Nicaragua dominated by American multinationals who actively exploited the advantages offered not only by a protected regionwide market but also by government tax and other fiscal inducements, a &quot;docile&quot; labor force, and low wage levels. According to an American businessman who worked in the construction industry, Nicaragua &quot;was an easy place to do business in but you had to know the type of business conducive to low labor costs. Much of the U.S. investment was to take advantage of the agrarian situation - fertile land and low labor costs - or to take advantage of tariff barriers of the CACM.&quot; Central American Bank for Economic Integration (BCIE) is also formed.</p>	1961	1961	5	98		medium	t	2015-02-13 04:07:52.207005	2015-02-13 04:07:52.207005	\N

634	The Soccer War	<p class="entry" style="color:#cc0000">The Soccer War breaks out between El Salvador and Honduras. The Central American Common Market collapses.</p>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\n&emsp;\r\nImmediately after Honduras loses the third of a trio of impassioned playoff matches to El Salvador—the final qualifying games for a single remaining slot in the 1970 World Cup championship in Mexico—the already strained relations between both nations reach a boiling point when the dictatorial Honduran president López Arellano severs diplomatic relations with his neighbor. The football rivalry coincided with a political dispute over immigration between the two countries.  Essentially, El Salvador was a smaller country than Honduras and had a much larger population.  The border between the two nations was less-than-perfectly defined, and an estimated 300,000 Salvadorians immigrated onto the more spacious Honduran territory, causing some resentment from native Hondurans.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAfter losing the first football match, El Salvadorian nationalist fervor erupted.  The fans were so riled that when the Honduran team came to El Salvador to play the second match, the Salvadorian Security Service had to hide the Honduran team at an undisclosed location.  As Honduran fans traveled home after losing the match, some Salvadorians threw rocks at their cars.\r\n<img src="/mapimages/soccerwar1969.jpg" class="floatright" style="max-width:100%;padding:0px;">\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nDue in large part to exaggerated media reports, unorganized mobs in Honduras retaliated against the Salvadorian immigrants living on Honduran territory.   Salvadorian business were destroyed, refugees fled, people were killed.  The Salvadorian government accused Honduras of genocide.  After intermittent border clashes, 12,000 Salvadoran troops cross the border in two columns on the afternoon of July 14, occupying the towns of El Amatillo and Nacaoné, as well as the regional capital of Nueva Ocotepeque— five miles from the frontier—by the next evening. According to a CIA report, “a nationwide Honduran radio network…exhorted civilians in the western highway area to grab machetes or other weapons and move to the front to assist the army.”World War II–vintage, propeller-driven airplanes are also used to drop bombs on Toncontin Air Base outside Tegucigalpa, while Honduran islands in the Gulf of Fonseca are assaulted. This offensive quickly bogs down, though, when Honduran F4U-5 Corsair fighters counterattack and severely damage El Salvador’s main oil-storage facilities at the port of Cutuco and Acajutla. The Salvadoran drive from Nueva Ocotepeque on toward Santa Rosa de Capán is then checked by Honduran warplanes, while air transports ferry 1,000 soldiers of the presidential “Guardia de Honor” Battalion from Tegucigalpa to reinforce that threatened town.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe Organization of American States arranges a cease-fire by the evening of July 18, which goes\r\ninto effect two days later.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe Salvadorans subsequently demand reparations for the more than 60,000 Salvadoran citizens who have been chased out of Honduras, as well as guarantees for the safety of those left behind. The\r\nthreat of economic sanctions, however, compels them to withdraw their troops by August 5. This\r\nconflict has inflicted between 2,000 and 3,000 fatalities on both sides, in addition to leaving thousands\r\nmore homeless and disrupting both frail economies. Repression of El Salvadoran activists during the conflict will fuel a shift to the left over the next decade.\r\n\r\nA peace treaty will not be concluded until October 30, 1980.\r\n</p>	1969	1969	4	48	Wars of the Americas, David Marley	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:52.320682	2015-02-13 04:07:52.320682	\N

Washington has the responsibility of operating and defending the Canal  through December 31, 1999, but not after that.\r\n<br>\r\nTorrijos won over many sectors of international capital by providing a financially hospitable environment for the international banking center. Most politically astute bankers realized that the health and longevity of this center, as well as the entire business climate, would be in jeopardy if the negotiations around the Canal treaties were not successful. Through the banks, Torrijos gained some powerful allies to lobby in Washington for the eventual return of the Canal to Panama, the centerpiece of his program. Indeed, once the 1977 treaties were ratified by the U.S. Congress in 1978, foreign investment in Panama increased again: from a negative $365,000 in 1978 to a positive $50.7 million in 1979.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n	1979	1979	5	59	Panama: Background and Buildup to 1989 US Invasion By Jane Franklin and Panama at the Crossroads By Andrew S.

The National Palace, a tasteless old building with pretensions of grandeur, takes up a whole block. The edifice is flanked by numerous windows; the columned façade of this banana parthenon looks out upon the desolate Square of the Republic. Besides the Senate, on the ground floor, and the Chamber of Deputies, on the first, it houses the Exchequer, the Ministry of the Interior and the Directorate-General of Revenue. Of all the Government buildings in Managua, it is the most public and the most heavily staffed. There is always a policeman, armed with a shotgun, stationed at every entrance, two more on the staircases leading to the first floor and several of the Ministers’ and Deputies’ armed bodyguards wander about the place. During working hours, between the basement, hallways and offices, no fewer than 3,000 people, employees and members of the general public are in the building. However, the leadership of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (SNLF) did not consider the storming of this marketplace of bureaucracy insanely simple, but just the opposite: a crazy masterstroke."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe group is led Commander Zero - Eden Pastora - takes the National Palace in Managua, holding 1,500 hostages, including 49 deputies of the national assembly. The two-day occupation focuses world attention on Nicaragua and the Sandinistas. One of the other leaders of the attack, commander two, is a twenty-two year old lesbian, Dora María Téllez, who later leads the successful taking of the city of Leon.\r\n<br>&emsp;Years later, both will split with the Ortega leadership: Pastora will reject the political dimensions of the revolution and form a Contra army in the South, ARDE; Téllez will push back against the sexist and homophobic machismo of the National Directorate and eventually form a dissident party (Movimiento de Renovación Sandinista) challenging the rightward shift of the Ortega-led Sandinista National Liberation Front.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="The View from Dora Maria Tellez I"></div>\r\n\r\n<table style="border-spacing: 10px;position:relative;top:-20px;"><tr><td valign=top width=55%><p class="entry">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/nicaraguanphostages.jpg">\r\n<br>&emsp;<strong>"This operation was planned well in advance.</strong> It was long\r\nand very detailed. So when we reached the palace, the\r\nlayout had already been surveyed. We had identified\r\nwhich people worked in what offices. Information had\r\nbeen compiled, and all the details precisely recorded.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThere was someone whom we called "la Espina"\r\nor "the thorn." He is the father of one of our leaders,\r\nComandante Pichardo, who is now one of the major\r\nmilitary leaders in the battle against the mercenary\r\nforces. So this man worked in the palace. We had\r\nphotographs of the palace, taken with a very small\r\ncamera. We had taken pictures of many rooms and staircases\r\nfrom different angles and we had architectural\r\nplans. We had also studied the access roads to the\r\npalace, and the time required to travel them. So those\r\nof us who were not familiar with the palace-as most\r\nof us were not-looked at the pictures, studied the plans\r\nand listened to the descriptions which our people who\r\nhad been in the palace were able to give us. At that time,\r\na new congressional session was being inaugurated, and the inauguration was broadcast on television.\r\n</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign="top">\r\n<p class="entry">\r\nThis also\r\nhelped us to \r\nstudy some of the palace interiors.\r\nHowever, the palace is very big, and we had really only\r\nplanned to take over the second floor. In fact that's what\r\nwe did, because 25 people were too few to take over\r\nthe entire palace. What happened was that we had to\r\nclose all the doors, and we stayed inside with 2,000\r\npeople.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIf these 2,000 people had panicked, if they had been\r\nagainst the action, probably none of us would have survived.\r\nOf the thousands that were there, some belonged\r\nto the Frente and supported the takeover. So they\r\nbehaved calmly, without provoking any kind of crisis\r\nor problems. They were very cooperative. This made\r\nthe success of the action possible.\r\nI am talking about the workers there. And I am talking\r\nabout the people who were in the palace that day.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nTaxes were paid in the palace. We entered the palace\r\nat noon, which is when most people go to pay taxes.\r\nThousands of people were milling around paying their\r\ntaxes, getting registered and doing things that had to\r\ndo with business. The workers in the palace maintained\r\na very positive attitude.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n<strong>The negotiations were based on several goals.</strong> One of\r\nthe main goals was to free political prisoners. The Sandinista\r\nFront had the tradition of never leaving its\r\nmilitants in prison. There was always a tradition of\r\nfighting politically for their liberty as well as one of taking\r\naction to get them out of jail. So our companeros\r\nwere our first priority. Secondly, we wanted money that\r\nwould help us to finance the struggle against Somocismo.\r\nBut money was not the primary objective. The essential\r\nobjective in the operation was to propose an alternative\r\nto a maneuver underway at the time. There was\r\nan effort to seek the displacement of Somoza while leaving\r\nthe political and military structure of Somocismo intact,\r\nputting any old civilian president in office to keep\r\nup the act. We called this Somocismo without Somoza.\r\nSeveral" \r\n</p>\r\n</td></tr></table>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="The View from Dora Maria Tellez II"></div>\r\n\r\n<table style="border-spacing: 10px;position:relative;top:-15px;"> <tr><td width=33%  valign="top">\r\n<p class="entry" style="font-size:.95em;-webkit-margin-before: .5em;">\r\n"groups had joined this maneuver: the financial\r\nbourgeoisie, other members of the bourgeoisie, several\r\nreligious groups and political parties. We felt that it was\r\nvery important to emphasize armed struggle as an essential\r\nalternative to overthrow the dictatorship, to present\r\nthe FSLN's program and to present a document to the\r\npeople and to the world which could explain what kind\r\nof maneuver was being undertaken, by whom, and how\r\nthis could be confronted.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nWe were able to transmit this message nationally, and\r\nit even had an international impact. So the negotiations\r\nrevolved around the publication of the documents which\r\nwe thought essential, and the liberation of political\r\nprisoners. There was no way out of this action; we had\r\nno retreat planned. There was no other alternative except\r\nto go ahead with the action or die. Obviously, the\r\ndictatorship rejected the publication of the documents\r\nand the prisoners' release. They wanted to try to attack,\r\nbut Anastasio Somoza had a nephew in there. And\r\nwhether Somoza yielded or not, he was being pressured\r\nby his own congressmen who were inside the Congress,\r\nand by the families who were outside. So the negotiations\r\ndragged on. They were trying to buy time to throw\r\nus out. But they didn't know how many of us there were.\r\nWe developed a technique which was to rotate those who\r\nwere guarding the doors and other places. Since we were\r\nalways changing places, people thought that there were\r\nfresh replacements, when in fact we were rotating. It\r\ngave the impression that there were a lot more of us\r\nthan there really were. Three bishops participated in the\r\nnegotiations, as well as the ambassadors of Venezuela,\r\nPanama and Spain.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nI can't remember how long in all, but it lasted about\r\n52 hours, a little over two days.\r\n</p>\r\n</td>\r\n\r\n<td width="66%">\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/nicaraguanptellez-v2.jpg">\r\n<p class="entry columns"  style="font-size:.95em;">&emsp;\r\n[On Staying Awake] <strong>That was very difficult. You know if you fall asleep,\r\nthey can kill you.</strong> The levels of tension and the very\r\ninstinct to survive keep you awake indefinitely. Otherwise\r\nit would be practically impossible. I began to sleep\r\nonly after leaving the palace, when we had almost\r\nreached Panama on the plane. The pressure during the\r\nnegotiations was intense; there were sporadic attacks\r\non the palace. They tried to get the mediators to make\r\nus retreat from our position. They didn't want to publish\r\nthe documents. It was a struggle. Of course, we knew\r\nthat they would have to yield.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were two feelings. On one hand, you were more\r\nafraid than inside the palace, because you were on a bus\r\nand much more vulnerable because you couldn't move.\r\nOf course you were travelling with bishops, you had\r\nhostages with you, but Somocismo could not be trusted.\r\nAnd on the other hand, there was an emotion which I\r\nthink is one of the greatest emotions I have had in my\r\nlife, to see the people in the street, defying the dictatorship.\r\nPeople were happy, celebrating in the streets.\r\nThere are two feelings which I have never been able\r\nto write down, and maybe I will never be able to write\r\ndown, those I felt on that day and on July 19, 1979,\r\nthe day of the victory. Both were very strong, full and\r\nvital emotions. And they were very significant, things\r\nwhich you can never repeat, and which can never be\r\nreproduced."</p>	1978	1978	7	58	NACLA	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:52.596988	2015-02-13 04:07:52.596988	\N

686	The Sheraton Dining Room Murders	<p class="entry columns" style="padding:5px 10px;background:white;">On the night of January 3, 1981, North Americans Michael Hammer, head of the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD<sup>1</sup>) in El Salvador as well as another AIFLD official, Mark Pearlman, working as advisers to El Salvador's agrarian reform program, together with Jose Viera, head of the Salvadorean agrarian reform agency, are gunned down in the restaurant of the Sheraton Hotel in San Salvador under orders of soldiers trained at the US School of Americas. \r\n<br>\r\nAccording to a 1985 special report by the National Labor Committee, two wealthy Salvadoran businessmen and large landowners - Ricardo Sol Meza and Hans Christ - were hosting a dinner party at the hotel that same evening. With them was Major Mario Denis Moran, head of the intelligence section of the Salvadoran National Guard and a military classmate of Roberto D'Aubuisson, then leader of the right wing ARENA party; Lieutenant Isidoro Lopez Sibrian, Major Moran's second-in-command; and Captain Eduardo Ernesto Alfonso Avila, also a D'Aubuisson associate.\r\n<br>\r\nIt is believed that Hans Christ, the businessman, first spotted and recognized the labor advisors. About thirty minutes later, Capt. Avila and Lt. Lopez Sibrian walked to the front of the hotel where two bodyguards were waiting. The officers gave these two National Guardsmen Ingram submachine guns equipped with silencers. Lt. Lopez Sibrian then ordered the killings and Has Christ led the Guardsmen through the hotel and physically pointed out the victims. The Guardsmen stepped through the door of the dining room and machine-gunned Hammer, Pearlman and Viera to death.\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Salvadoran Guardsmen who actually carried out the killing, Valle Acevedo and Gomez Gonzalez, eventually served short terms in prison for their crimes. Major Moran, Captain Avila, and Lt. Sibrian were never charged, despite the American Embassy presenting two new witnesses who gave sworn testimony that Captain Avila had confessed a direct role in the killings to them. According to the 1993 UN Truth Commission Report on El Salvador, the US Army trained all three at the School of the Americas (SOA).\r\n<br>\r\n"In this time when the US government is trying to lead a worldwide campaign against terrorism, it is incumbent that we start by cleaning up our own backyard," stated Michael's brother, Frank Hammer, at the twenty-fifth anniversary. "To stop terrorism, we must stop exporting it ourselves."\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p style="font-size:small; padding:5px 10px;background:white;">1. The AIFLD came formally into being in 1961 and was technically under the direction of the American labor movement (AFL-CIO), but was soon being funded almost exclusively by the US government (AID) and serving consistently as a CIA instrument in most countries of Latin America. \r\nThere was no direct evidence that Hammer or Pearlman were working with the CIA, although an odd incident shortly after their murder raised the issue. In January 1981, Solicitor General Wade H. McCree ]r., testifying on the need for a law that would make it a\r\ncrime to reveal the names of CIA operatives, cited Hammer and Pearlman as examples of people who had been operating “under cover.” Later he denied that he had meant to imply they were working for the CIA.

(In other words, his kin were expected to believe the journalist had drawn on the vast array of local contacts that a man with limited command of Spanish could develop in his first two hours in a strange country!)\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Sullivan was mistaken for a Belgian missionary priest who was thought to be aiding the guerrillas and he was subjected to torture techniques taught at the School of the Americas.\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time his interrogators realized no man could endure such agony without imparting some information, the journalist was too disfigured to be set free. So they staked him out with a stick of dynamite tied to each ankle and each wrist, and jammed another stick of dynamite into his mouth, thinking they would blow away John Sullivan's identity forever.\r\n<br>\r\nWith no assistance from the State Department, the family was reduced to pleading for information via paid ads in Salvadoran newspapers. [The family members have repeatedly charged that their quest was blocked because of fears of jeopardizing millions of dollars in military aid to El Salvador.]\r\n<br>\r\nA troubled policeman finally disclosed where the body had been discarded, X-rays of an old football injury confirmed the identity, and at least Sullivan could be brought home to rest in the family plot."\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nfrom <i>PROBLEM WITH SOA TRAINING IS IN THE EXECUTION</i> Editorial by Jack McKinney, The Philadelphia Daily News\r\nFriday, May 2, 1997</i>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>John Sullivan checks into the same Sheraton Hotel (and is abducted) a week before the Sheraton Killings happened.</strong>\r\n</p>	1981	1981	1	77		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:52.705252	2015-02-13 04:07:52.705252	\N

720	Operation Tipped Kettle	<p class="entry">May 1983<br>\r\n<i>Felipe Vidal's Cuban contingent, later known as the International Brigade, arrives to join Southern Front. The CIA and the Defense Department arrange for Israel to transfer captured PLO weapons to contras. Known as &quot;Operation Tipped Kettle,&quot; the deal is overseen by Richard Secord, who had just retired from the military under a cloud of scandal.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title=""></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\n<strong>The truth about Israel, Iran and 1980s U.S. arms deals\r\n<i>Recently declassified Pentagon documents reveal a strange, not to say illicit, 1980s operation called 'Tipped Kettle,' in which weapons stolen by Israel from the PLO in Lebanon were transferred to the Contras and to anti-American elements in Iran</i>\r\nBy Amir Oren Nov. 26, 2010</strong>\r\nThe collection of declassified documents published two weeks ago by the Pentagon reveals infighting among branches of the U.S. administration and intrigues in foreign countries - including 1980s' Israel. The impression one gets is not especially positive. The Americans are publishing the documents now not because they are trying somehow to suggest to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu how he should behave, but because the law obligates them to reveal records in due course following a review, unless there is a genuine reason to keep them secret. In the aforesaid period Netanyahu served as deputy to Moshe Arens, when he was Israel's ambassador to Washington, D.C. (1982-83 ). Arens' staff then also included Gen. Menachem Meron, the military attache in Washington, and spokesman Nachman Shai. Arens and his aides constituted an island of sanity in their relations with the administration of U.S. President Ronald Reagan, at a time of hostility in the U.S. capital toward the government of Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Defense Minister Ariel Sharon.\r\n<br>\r\nThe recently revealed documents deal with an operation dubbed "Tipped Kettle," involving weapons the Israel Defense Forces looted from the Palestine Liberation Organization during Operation Peace for Galilee in Lebanon, and their transfer to the Contras - opponents of the socialistic Sandinista regime in Nicaragua. That was the first episode, of rather questionable legality according to U.S. law, in a more complex story whose second installment, in 1985-1986, became known as the Iran-Contra scandal. Part II was patently illegal - a blatant effort by the White House to violate a Congressional order and to cook up a strange deal involving the sale of American weapons (originally supplied to the IDF ) to anti-American Iran, for use in its war with Iraq; the release of Western hostages being held in Lebanon by Iranian-controlled Hezbollah; and the financing of Contras' activities thanks to the difference between the sum paid by the Iranians and the true value of the weapons - minus a profit for those engaged in the deal.\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of that decade, during the trial of U.S. Marine Col. Oliver North and other officials in the Reagan administration, charged with deceiving Congress and providing false testimony to a special prosecutor, Operation Tipped Kettle was also briefly mentioned in the court proceedings. Now, however, the whole picture has come into view, with its emphasis on the behavior on the Israeli side.\r\n<br>\r\nIn the fall of 1982, Reagan's secretary of defense, Caspar Weinberger, was trying to implement a policy intended to combat pro-Soviet elements in Latin America, including the Sandinistas. Even more belligerent than he was CIA director William Casey. The CIA had direct intelligence connections with the Mossad, but in the affair of the captured weapons the American agency preferred to hide behind the Pentagon. The system of communication between the CIA and the Pentagon was called Focal Point; it had been used to facilitate connections between them since the mid-1950s. Officially, Israel was unaware then that the weapons taken from the PLO would be used not by the U.S. Army in its training bases, but rather to arm the Contras.</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title=""></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\nThough the Republicans controlled the White House at the time, the Democrats controlled Congress. The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Edward Boland, achieved a majority for a series of bills named for him, which limited the administration's ability to help the Contras. In one of the bills, passed in the fall of 1984, all U.S. intelligence agencies were prohibited from any such activity. (North tried to outsmart the law, claiming, after he came under investigation, that the National Security Council, which coordinated the operations, was not an intelligence agency. )\r\n\r\nThe legislation meant, in effect, that without the specific approval of Congress, no money could be formally budgeted in this case. Therefore, Casey, North and their colleagues had to use subterfuge to supply the arms, for example, by way of "donations" from foreign countries - Saudi Arabia, the Sultanate of Brunei - or circuitous deals with South Korea, Taiwan, China and especially Israel. The loot captured from the PLO during the war, at a cost of hundreds of Israeli dead, was particularly suitable for use by the Contras. And if Kalashnikov rifles fell into the hands of the Sandinistas, there would have been fewer questions about its source.\r\n\r\n'No policy problem'\r\n\r\nThe first of the Pentagon documents concerning Operation Tipped Kettle was sent by Weinberger to Casey on November 17, 1982. The subject: rifles, machine guns and light mortars for infantry fighters "captured by Israeli forces in Lebanon." The Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency "can offer assistance in helping to acquire significant amounts of these types of weapons presently available in Lebanon." The letter didn't say from whom exactly the weapons would be purchased - from the Christian Phalange forces, from other organizations or from Palestinians in areas outside IDF control. The State Department, added Weinberger, had "no policy problem with this effort as long as it is not publicized."\r\n\r\n"In a separate action, our efforts to obtain captured weapons directly from the Israeli government have been delayed while their military attache, MG Meron, is out of the Washington area. He should return within the next few days and the subject will be raised at that time ... We are prepared to meet your request through the Focal Point System," wrote Weinberger.\r\n\r\nIn March 1983, four months later, Weinberger sent Casey a second letter, declaring, "I am glad to report significant progress." In February, back in Israel, the Kahan Commission of inquiry report on the massacres in the Sabra and Chatila refugee camps in Beirut was submitted, as a consequence of which Ariel Sharon was dismissed as defense minister. At that point, staff from the embassy in Washington took over at the ministry in Tel Aviv: Arens was at the top, Meron became director general, and Shai was media adviser.\r\n\r\nWeinberger reported that "a joint DoD/CIA survey team visited Israel and was shown about 300 metric tons of captured weapons and ammunition suitable for your purposes. Shortly after Ambassador Arens became the new Israeli MOD, the DoD was informed that these weapons would be provided to the U.S. at a small percentage of their market value. This charge, which I understand will be agency funded, would only be for packing and handling and is anticipated to be in the neighborhood of $100,000. My staff is in the process of setting up the movement of these weapons to the U.S. Due to the weight and bulk of these items they will have to be moved by surface transport and thereby will not be available until the May/June timeframe."\r\n\r\nThat same day, the U.S. Navy was instructed to provide transport for "military items ... that will be shipped from the Israeli port of Ashdod ... to the East Coast of the United States."</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title=""></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\nWeinberger updated Casey: "The shipment will be available for CIA pickup" and "can remain packed in the 34 Land/Sea containers until reaching their destination. The Land/Sea containers are the property of the Government of Israel and will need to be ... returned to Israel."\r\n\r\nThe shipment included 20,000 rifles and submachine guns, 1,000 machine guns, 90 recoil-less rifles, 110 mortars, 1,000 hand grenades and a large amount of ammunition. "The then newly appointed Israeli minister of defense, Moshe Arens, made the final decision that these weapons were to be provided on a gratis basis to DoD. This was one of MOD Arens' first actions ... and was clearly a signal of his desire to improve U.S./Israel relations," according to the Pentagon documents.\r\n\r\nIsrael, with one-time and well-calculated generosity, did not lose much money here: In the 1980s, private arms dealers sold similar Kalashnikov rifles, made in Yugoslavia, for $210 each. The market value of all the Kalashnikovs in the shipment in question was only about $4 million; 60-mm. mortars were sold for about $1,500 and 81-mm. mortars for about $5,000.\r\n\r\nAdded costs\r\n\r\nA year later, the CIA's appetite was whetted again; now there were additional factors in the equation. Weinberger's new undersecretary for international security, Richard Armitage, became a close friend and regular visitor of the new military attache, Gen. Uri Simhoni; the same was true of Weinberger's senior military assistant, Gen. Colin Powell.\r\n\r\nIn June 1984, Weinberger received a memo from Armitage describing the process by which the looted weapons had been transferred a year earlier. Armitage mentioned that the mission was accomplished as a result of talks between Maj. Gen. Richard Secord and Meron, and a decision by Arens. In February 1984 the Pentagon was asked to find out whether there were additional weapons available in Israel "under the same financial terms" - i.e., "available for operational use at little or no cost." In contacts with the Israeli government a few months earlier, in March, it turned out that there were additional weapons stolen from the PLO caches, including Katyushas and anti-aircraft weapons, but that they were "for sale." A joint Pentagon-CIA survey delegation, headed by the liaison officer with Israel (whose name is erased, apparently a Col. Forster ), went to Israel to examine the items.\r\n\r\n"Contacts with the GOI," noted Armitage dryly, "revealed that they had placed a value of over $77M on these weapons, while DoD sources estimated the cost of the weapons at around $27M." Or, according to another estimate, $35 million. The head of the U.S. Army Museum, an expert on Soviet weapons, estimated the value at only $17 million.\r\n\r\nArmitage's deputy, U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. Edward Tixier, Secord's successor, was traveling to Israel to discuss a different matter and said he would speak privately to director general Meron to discuss transferring the second collection of captured weapons to the Pentagon at little or no cost. If Tixier succeeded, the weapons could arrive in the U.S. at the end of July and be sent immediately to the CIA.\r\n\r\nPrior to the Armitage-Simhoni meeting on May 24, Armitage wrote to a liaison officer subordinate to him that "the chances of the U.S. ever obtaining these weapons is poor if they are not in our possession by July 23, 1984 (the date of the upcoming Israeli election ). Our contacts in the Israel MOD (to include both Mr. Arens and Gen. Meron ) could be gone the following day, and establishing relations with new players could be time-consuming."</p>\r\n<br><div class="page" data-title=""></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\nAccording to the recently declassified documents, Israeli activity was frozen at the time, because of "the confusion in the GOI over what direction U.S. policy in Central America is heading and the role that Israel can and should play in relation to the topic. If you feel that timing is right you may which to discuss the issue of payment for these weapons. Because Israeli funds would have to be found to cover specific project related costs (packing, crating, shipping ), we should offer to pay these line items. We should not offer to pay anything for the weapons for two reasons: the weapons will be used to further Western interests, and in the grand scheme of U.S./Israeli relations, a good will gesture on the part of Israel (at a low dollar cost for them ) would be most helpful with the GOI is requesting U.S. assistance on major projects such as funding for the new SAAR-5 missile-attack boat, the Lavi, the F-4 upgrade, the upgrading of the Merkava tank, and the usage of FMS funds off-shore, to mention a few.\r\n\r\n"Prior to moving any of this equipment, there needs to be a lead time of several weeks, so that our EOD [explosive ordnance disposal] and logistics people can do the planning required to make this operation work. There is no time to spare if we are to complete this effort prior to Israeli elections."\r\n\r\nIn order to save time, Meron suggested that packing of the weaponry begin - this time, over 100 containers were needed - while internal consultation in Israel continued.\r\n\r\nThe Arens-Meron camp, the Americans reported to their dispatchers, had two problems: IDF Chief of Staff Moshe Levi, eager to speed up the withdrawal of the IDF from Lebanon, gave top priority to establishing a security zone and therefore also arming of the forces of Saad Hadad - which became the South Lebanon Army - with the weapons in question. The IDF's security assistance unit, headed by Col. (res. ) Zvi Reuter, and foreign relations department, demanded monetary compensation. Above all, the clock was ticking: Soon there would be a new Knesset and perhaps a new defense minister, who would bring in a new director general.\r\n\r\nIn the last telegram from Tel Aviv, bearing the censored signature of the liaison officer, there is an hour-by-hour description of the consultations, maneuvering and bargaining: hints that the price could be reduced if a way could be found to increase the aid; anger in the Pentagon at the Israeli chutzpah; examination of alternatives; encrypted telegrams from the embassy; bridging proposals; a "gentlemen's agreement" without signatures.\r\n\r\nThe elections came and went and the race between Labor, headed by Shimon Peres, and Likud, headed by Yitzhak Shamir, ended in a tie. A week later, before the Peres-Shamir government was formed, Arens signed an approval of the transaction: Weapons worth $30 million to $40 million in exchange for the expectation of an increase in military assistance. Arens was forced to vacate the ministry in favor of Yitzhak Rabin, who like him was pro-American, but Meron remained in the post of director general for two more years.\r\n\r\nThe Tipped Kettle papers end with an internal memo, with no addressees or signatories, which was written on the day the Iran-Contra affair was exposed, in November 1986. It reports that Reuter, the head of security assistance , complained that the debt for the second transaction had yet to be paid. The complaint was examined in the Pentagon and it revealed an astonishing finding. The Israeli military attache's office in Washington and the international branch of the Defense Department had reached a secret arrangement: In return for Israel waiving the payment, the U.S. defense contractor Numax was to retain its security clearance and government contracts after being purchased by Israel.\r\n\r\nWhat the officers and ministers, the officials and ambassadors are doing in secret today will be revealed, thanks to the Americans in another 25 years.\r\n</p>	1983	1983	4	86		large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:52.939786	2015-02-13 04:07:52.939786	\N

719	Contadora Group Formed	<div class="page" data-title="Trying for Peace"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="background-color:white;padding:6px;position:relative;top:190px;">\r\n&emsp; The beginnings of the Contadora Group surged forth in January of 1983.  The seeds were planted by the Colombian Nobel Prize winner for Literature, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Alfonso Garcia Robles from Mexico, Nobel Prize winner, Alba Myrdal and Sweden's Prime Minister, Olof Palme.  They called for the Presidents of Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela and Panama to act as mediators in the Central American conflict and to seek negotiated end to the Nicaraguan war.  The stated purpose of Contadora was to find a peaceful solution to the regional crisis, and in particular, to promote peaceful coexistence between Sandinista Nicaragua on the one hand and the United States with its Central American allies on the other, but the group's emphasis on <i>peaceful</i> coexistence with Nicaragua ran counter to the increasingly hard-line anti-Sandinista posture emanating from Washington.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe Contadora Group issued its first set of proposals in July 1983. It proposed the withdrawal of all foreign military advisers from Central America, the end of all aid to irregular forces, and the cessation of tension generating military maneuvers in the border regions. In September 1983 the Contadora Group produced a draft 21-point peace treaty which was drawn up after consultation with the Central American carnal. This 'Document of Objectives' was primarily concerned with security issues, although the treaty included some references to internal issues such as promoting national reconciliation, the establishment of 'democratic, representative and pluralistic systems', and respect for human rights. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThese peace proposals were accompanied by intense regional diplomatic activity. The Contadora Group met eleven times in 1983. The Central American foreign ministers met six times as part of the Contadora process. The technical commission, composed of representative from all the Central American countries met four times. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn July 1983 the Nicaraguan government issued a six-point peace pro-posal incorporating the July Contadora proposals, and calling again for the immediate signing of a non-aggression pace between Honduras and Nicaragua. In December 1983, Nicaragua submitted eight draft peace treaties to the Contadora Group, calling for peace agreements to be negotiated within Central America and with the United States. In January 1984 the Contadora Group and the Central American nations attempted to strengthen the process by creating three joint committees, to deal with security, political, and social and economic issues.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn June 1984 Contadora presented its 'Draft Act on Peace and Coop-eration'. After amendments from all five republics were incorporated into a September revised act, Guatemala and Costa Rica both agreed to sign. Of the five governments, Nicaragua had been one of the most critical of the revised act, \r\ndisliking the Act's proposal for international monitoring of internal political processes and openly unhappy at the prospect of establishing regionally-defined force limits while direct US military pressures and the war with the "Contra" rebels continued.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="The Masters of War"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="background-color:white;padding:6px;position:relative;top:280px;">\r\n\r\n&emsp;\r\nYet on 21 September 1984, it was the Nicaraguan government which became the first of the five to sign the Act. The US reacted to this entirely unexpected decision by persuading Honduras to convene a meeting of the Central American countries, again excluding Nicaragua. In October 1984 Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica produced the `Tegucigalpa document' which contained a series of amendments to the Contadora Ace designed to weaken its impact and legitimise a continuing US military presence in the region. The US had objected to those parts of the Act which prohibited international military exercises and foreign military bases and which called for the immediate cessation of arms acquisitions. The Tegucigalpa document proposed to `regulate' military exercises as opposed to ending them. It also would have allowed for a continuation of foreign military bases in the region. A leaked US National Security Council Document discussed how, through intensive US regional diplomacy, 'We have effectively blocked efforts made by the Contadora Group to impose their second version of the Contadora Act.\r\n<br>&emsp;The Contadora Group carried on meeting throughout 1985, although it faced continued intransigence from the United States, which initiated more massive military exercises in Honduras in February 1985. In April 1985, the United States attempted to transfer the peace process from within the framework of the Contadora process to the OAS. The only support for this proposal came from Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica and the now pro-US Grenada. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn June and July 1985, vice-president Sergio Ramirez embarked on a tour of Latin America in an effort to retake the diplomatic initiative and revive active support for the peace process. Asa result of this visit, Argentina, Brasil, Peru and Uruguay agreed to create a support group for the Contadora process, the 'Lima Group'. Collectively the Contadora and Lima Groups became known as the 'Group of 8'. Attempts by the United Stares to enlarge the group to include the more pro-US Ecuador and the Dominican Republic were unsuccessful." \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe formation of the Lima Group gave an impetus to the search for peace, at more or less the same time that the United States Congress approved a massive $100 million of contra aid. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n	1983	1983	8	75	Hazel Smith, 'The Conservative Approach: Sandinista Nicaragua's Foreign Policy'	large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:53.001639	2015-02-13 04:07:53.001639	\N
729	Monge's Neutrality Proclamation	Sept. 15: Monge's Neutrality Proclamation.  The  Monge administration was clearly inclined to intervene more directly against   the contra camps on its border once death-squad style murders of leftist Costa   Rican citizens and burning and looting of stores owned by contra supporters   began. The Monge administration moved consistently after mid-1983 toward a more   effectively neutral position vis a vis the Nicraguan border fighting in   particular, and the Central American crisis in general. This move was opposed   throughout by the United States and important Rightist elements within Costa   Rica, and even within the administration itself. TEXT OF COSTA RICAN NEUTRALTY STATUTE  &quot;We declare that Costa Rica will observe neutrality in all   armed conflicts affecting the states of the international   community, subject to the following:   Active   Our neutrality does not imply impartiality in ideological   and political conflicts in the world. Costa Rica has   maintained and will continue to maintain the political and   social concepts it shares with Western democracies. This   neutrality will not prevent it from actively exercising its   rights as a member of the United Nations and the OAS in all   actions aimed at preserving international peace and security,   except those having military implications; at achieving a more   just social and economic system in relations among states; and   at the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms.   Autonomous   Our neutrality is based on our sovereignty. Our country   does not recognize the right of any state to interpret the   consequences of this declaration of neutrality to determine,   define, or limit our country's foreign policy, either at the   United Nations and its agencies, at the OAS, or in bilateral   relations with other states. We ratify the obligations   imposed on us by international treaties and pacts that we have   signed, and we request that in the collective security systems   to which we belong we be freed from participating in military   actions, which we have not taken Part in for more than 30 years because we do not have an army. Instead, in those   situations we have preferred to fulfill our duties through   humanitarian actions. . .&quot;  	1983	1983	1	31		medium	f	2015-02-13 04:07:53.010083	2015-02-13 04:07:53.010083	\N

731	La Penca	<div class="page" data-title=Dirty Tricks"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="position:relative;top:190px;background-color: rgba(255,255,255,.7);padding:10px;">Oct. 1, 1983 <br>\r\nImmigration records show La Penca terrorists, &quot;Per Anker Hansen&quot; and &quot;Patricia Anne Boone Mariscot&quot; first arrive in Costa Rica.  For the CIA and North network, la Penca signals the point at which Costa Rica is converted from a base for conventional warfare against Nicaragua into an arena for "unconventional" warfare. Before La Penca, the United States had been attempting to build up the Southern Front as the mirror image of the Northern Front in Honduras with a large, uniﬁed, conventional contra army. Afterward the Sandinistas launched a major offensive against ARDE, sending hundreds of guerrillas fleeing into Costa Rica. Political in-fighting, the bombing, and the Sandinista assault left ARDE badly crippled. \r\n<br>\r\nHowever, rather than regrouping and rebuilding the Southern Front forces, U.S. strategists moved, over the coming months, to swiftly dismantle those that remained and to replace them with a small "dirty tricks" network whose main task was not to fight against the Sandinista army but to stage terrorist actions designed to be blamed on the Sandinistas. In the process Costa Rica, the region's only real democracy, was to become the base for what is known in the covert trade as "simulated terrorism," actions designed to be blamed on one’s enemy and to cause a public outcry. Simulated terrorism is a well-established CIA tactic. Miami Cubans involved with the Southern Front adopted it in their war against Fidel Castro, John Hull employed it as a CIA operative in Brazil, and the contras used it in border incidents.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<span style="background:yellow;">\r\nIn late May 1984 Pastora took a boatload of reporters to a jungle hideout on the Costa Rican-Nicaraguan border. Once ashore at a tiny town called La Penca the crowd assembled, the reporters took out their tape recorders, the TV men unloaded their cameras. One man posing as a photographer for a European magazine excused himself, saying he had left something in the launch. It was then the bomb went off. Pastora was injured, and three reporters lay dead. Several more were wounded. The suspected assassin pretended on the boat ride back from the jungle hideout that he had also been injured.

Parallel to these plots, this same group became increasingly involved in drug trafficking for both personal proﬁt and to help finance the contra war after Congress cut off funding. Contra operations provided a perfect womb for securely moving cocaine from Colombia through Costa Rica to the United States: personnel, airplanes, landing strips, loose financial records, and, most important, protection under the aegis of a clandestine CIA operation. In Costa Rica, guardsmen and contras protected private landing strips and farms in Guanacaste and San Carlos that were used for arms deliveries and military. \r\n<br>On some of these same farms, planes were reloaded with sacks of cocaine for their return run to the States. When planes landed at commercial or military airports in the United States, DEA and customs agents were routinely kept away, told not to inspect because this was a covert Agency mission. In some cases, CIA operatives within the anti-Sandinista network made deals to give drug cartel officials immunity from prosecution. In return, drug dollars flowed into the contras’ war chest and into the private bank accounts of certain rebel leaders and CIA oficials. As Miami-based former federal attorney John Mattes put it, "There was a marriage of convenience between the contras and the coke smugglers. The smugglers had access to intelligence, airstrips, and, most importantly, unimpeded access into the U.S. And that to a drug smuggler is worth all the tea in China." These activities—terrorism and drug trafficking—were among the most closely guarded secrets of the Iran-contra scandal. <br>\r\nThe La Penca bombing represented the union of U.S.-sponsored murder and narcotics smuggling under the banner of ﬁghting communism, but la Penca itself was just one event in a much broader and more complex panorama. Even after years of our own investigations, coupled with those of the Christic Institute and other journalists and researchers, as well as judicial and congressional inquiries in both the United States and Costa Rica, many mysteries remain. But enough had been revealed about the underworld surrounding Washington's war against Nicaragua to show that, as the young frightened contra "David" whispered to Carlos Rojas, "These people are involved in drug and arms trafficking and they are making money off the blood of my brothers."</p>	1983	1983	1	86	Hostile Acts: U.

It made the mistake of bringing in retired Special Forces veterans who had served in Vietnam. In one embarrassing\r\nepisode, they convinced the Agency to translate into Spanish an old comic book instructing Vietnamese peasants on ways to take\r\nover a village by murdering the mayor, chief of police, and militia. The CIA distributed a Spanish-language version of this\r\n“Freedom Fighter's Manual” to the contras. Some ended up in the hands of opponents of the U.S. wars in Central America, who\r\nmade them public. Americans also learned that the CIA had mined Nicaraguan harbors, which provoked conservative icon\r\nBarry Goldwater to scold Casey. “I am pissed off,” he wrote. “This is an act violating international law. It is an act of War."\r\n<br>\r\nCongress reacted in October 1984 by strengthening the Boland Amendment and cutting off all aid to the contras. In order to\r\ntie Casey's hands, Congress explicitly prohibited any intelligence agency from soliciting funds from “any nation, group,\r\norganization, movement, or individual.” Chief of Staff James Baker feared that administration “crazies” would nonetheless solicit\r\nfunds from other countries, which Casey, McFarlane, and North proceeded to do. Saudi Arabia provided the lion’s share, but\r\nother nations, including Apartheid South Africa, Israel, and Taiwan, pledged millions of dollars more. Shultz had warned Reagan that\r\napproving further assistance would constitute an impeachable offense. But Casey, Bush, and Reagan all pooh-poohed that\r\nnotion.\r\n</p>\r\n	1984	1984	5	97		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:53.209692	2015-02-13 04:07:53.209692	\N

The Bedouin King was the largest single contributor to the contras. Congressional investigators traced a total of $33.6 million that passed through Adolfo Calero's FDN bank account. Of that amount, $32 million was received from Saudi Arabia. It was a small price to pay for continued U.S. military support for his regime. Fahd gave many times that amount to the Afghan Mujahadeen, another U.S.-backed\r\nanti-communist force.\r\n<br>\r\nThe man who opened the doors to the Mullah's moolah was General Richard Secord. As the head of the Pentagon's foreign military sales program from 1978 to 1981, Secord oversaw the sales of billions of dollars in military equipment to the nations of the Middle East. In 1981, Secord and Oliver North successfully lobbied Congress to support the $8.5 billion sale of AWACS surveillance planes to Saudi Arabia over the stiff objection of the Israeli lobby, thus assuring King Fahd's support of the contras.\r\n<br>\r\nKing Fahd is the world's second richest monarch, with a personal fortune estimated at $20 billion. The world's weahhlest monarch is the Suhan of Brunei, a tiny oil-rich country near Borneo.

In return the United States would pledge to halt shipments of arms to the contras. This proposal received wide media acclaim as fair and just; the Iran-contra hearings that had concluded two days earlier had passed into ancient history, along with their suggestion that a U.S. pledge might be worth less than gold. Nevertheless, to the surprise and annoyance of the administration, the Central American presidents reached an agreement on August 7.  \r\n<br>&emsp;Government propaganda then shifted, predictably, to the demolition of the unacceptable accords. The media followed faithfully along. I have reviewed the details elsewhere, so I will only summarize this most remarkable campaign.  \r\n<br>&emsp;The problem to be addressed was a familiar one: a great power has been unable to impose its will and finds itself confronted with conditions and circumstances that it refuses to accept. A state that commands unusual power, such as the United States, has a variety of ways to deal with the problem. One is to pretend that the adversary has capitulated, accepting the U.S. stand. This option can be pursued only if the information system can be trusted to fall into line, presenting the U.S. government version as if it were true, however outlandish the pretense. If the media meet their responsibilities in this way, then the adversary must indeed accept U.S. terms, or else suffer retribution for violating the alleged solemn commitment to adhere to them.  \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOne striking example of this technique was the treatment of the Paris peace treaty of January 1973, which the United States was compelled to sign after the failure of its attempt to bludgeon North Vietnam into submission by the Christmas B-52 bombings of populated areas. The U.S. government at once offered a version of the treaty that was diametrically opposed to its terms on every crucial point. This version was uniformly accepted and promulgated by the media, so that the actual terms of the peace treaty had been dismissed to the memory hole literally within a few days. The United States and its South Vietnamese client then proceeded with massive violations of the actual treaty in an effort to attain their long-sought goals by violence, and when the Vietnamese adversaries finally responded in kind, they were universally denounced for the breakdown of the agreements and compelled to suffer for their crime. The case of the Central America peace accords was similar. It was necessary to refashion them to conform to U.S. dictates, a task that was accomplished with the anticipated cooperation of the media, though it took a little longer than the overnight victory at the time of the Paris peace accords–perhaps an indication that the media really have become more &quot;adversarial&quot; than in the past.  \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe first requirement of the demolition campaign was to establish that it was U.S. support for the contras that had forced the Sandinistas to negotiate. This is always an important doctrine, since it can be exploited to justify subsequent resort to armed force and terror. The thesis hardly withstands the evidence of history: Nicaragua's effort to pursue the peaceful means required by international law through the World Court, the United Nations, and the Contadora process, and Washington's success in &quot;trumping&quot; these initiatives. Such problems were readily overcome by dismissal of the facts to the memory hole. The required doctrinal truth then became the merest cliché. The New York Times editors could therefore criticize Michael Dukakis during the 1988 election campaign because he &quot;undervalues the role of force in bringing the Sandinistas to the bargaining table.&quot; It would be unreasonable to expect troublesome facts to stand in the way of a principle that authorizes continued reliance on violence as the necessary means for bringing peace. More generally, what is useful is True. Period.  \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe first task was accomplished with dispatch. The next problem was to dismantle the accords themselves. Their first phase ran from the signing in August 1987 to January 1988, when the Central American presidents were to receive the report of the International Verification Commission (CIVS), which was charged with monitoring the accords. The goal of the Reagan administration was to focus all attention on the Sandinistas, thus ensuring that the United States could maintain the attack by its proxy forces and exclude the U.S. client states from the provisions of the accords. The media at once dedicated themselves to these further tasks, and by January the last shreds of the original accords disappeared, replaced by the initial U.S. terms. Henceforth, the irrelevant facts become of interest only to archivists. It is the necessary illusions that prevail.  \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe peace plan specified one &quot;indispensable element&quot; for peace, namely, a termination of open or covert aid of any form (&quot;military, logistical, financial, propagandistic&quot;) to &quot;irregular forces&quot; (the contras) or &quot;insurrectionist movements&quot; (indigenous guerrillas). In response, the United States at once stepped up its illegal CIA supply flights, which had already reached the phenomenal level of one a day in an effort to keep the proxy forces in the field. These doubled in September and virtually tripled in the months that followed. Surveillance flights also increased. Successes were immediately evident as contra attacks on civilians doubled in intensity, including ambushes, murders, attacks on farm cooperatives, and kidnappings. The CIA also offered bribes to Miskito leaders to prevent them from joining the peace process.  \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe peace agreements were thus effectively dead from the first moment. These were, by far, the most significant developments during the August-January phase of the accords. <br>\r\n<span class="entry_source">Necessary Illusions, Noam Chomsky</span></p>	1987	1987	1	44		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:53.59005	2015-02-13 04:07:53.59005	\N

But some members of Congress expressed skepticism at the Administration's portrayal of the urgency of the situation in Honduras, as well as irritation that plans for troop movements appeared to be under way while they were being denied on Capitol Hill.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nCongress rejected military aid last month, but Reagan has said he will continue to seek new funding for the rebels.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAlthough the Administration's public statements portrayed Nicaragua as undertaking a large-scale invasion of Honduras, officials appeared unable during a private session with congressional leaders to present evidence that the situation was as dire as it first appeared.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nHouse Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), who spent 1 1/2 hours with Secretary of State George P. Shultz, White House Chief of Staff Howard H. Baker Jr. and Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, the White House national security adviser, told reporters: "The Administration is making somewhat unclear references to a crisis."<br>&emsp;\r\nThe New York Times writes: \r\n<span class="blockquote" style="font-style:italic;">\r\n&emsp;"Whenever a nation offers sanctuary to guerrillas embroiled in a neighbor's civil war, it incurs a risk. During the Vietnam War, President Nixon repeatedly used the argument of hot pursuit to justify incursions into Cambodia and Laos. Nicaragua can make the same argument with even more justification; Honduras is required to close contra camps under the regional peace plan it signed last August. Honduras has ignored the requirement, and so does Mr. Reagan even as he upbraids Nicaragua for failing to comply with other provisions of the plan.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n"It has happened before. In March 1986 <span style=" font-style: normal; color:#cc0000;">[See Below]</span>, a cross-border raid was magnified into a menacing invasion; the Honduran President was nudged into requesting U.S. help to ferry troops to the jungle frontier. Despite denials, there's more than a suspicion this time that President Jose Azcona Hoyo requested U.S. troops only after American prodding. Yesterday he went further, sending planes to retaliate inside Nicaragua."\r\n</span>\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:small;background-color:#000;padding:10px;color:#fff;position:relative;top:-20px;">\r\n<span style=" font-style: normal; color:#cc0000;">1986</span><br>\r\n&emsp;The occupation of Honduras by U.S. troops met little opposition during the first half of the eighties. The situation began to change, however, in 1986 following the U.S. airlift into Honduras of 3,200 rapid-deployment troops in response to a Nicaraguan offensive against the Honduras-based contras. Popular organizations began to demand the removal of U.S. troops and bases, while media commentators and politicians expressed concern that the country's dignity and sovereignty were being trampled upon by the United States. U.S. troops became the target of bombings and ambushes. Instigation of most of the attacks was either claimed by the country's small guerilla groups or blamed on them. Significantly, however, the U.S. embassy did not dismiss the possibility that the Honduran military itself was responsible for at least one bombing.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n	1988	1988	1	83	The NY Times, LA Times, and Inside Honduras by Norsworthy and Barry	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:53.705016	2015-02-13 04:07:53.705016	\N

818	Bush Supports Widening CIA Role	<p class="entry" style="background-color:white;"><span class="intro">October 17, 1989</span> Bush Administration supports wider role for CIA in coup attempts, complaining that restraints about possible death of targets is too limiting. The White House declared that President Bush has "complete confidence" in CIA Director William H. Webster.</p>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size: .95em;background-color:white;">\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/williamwebsterbush.jpg" class="floatright">\r\n&emsp;William H. Webster, the Director of Central Intelligence, called today on the President and Congress to consider giving the Central Intelligence Agency greater latitude in supporting potentially violent efforts to overthrow foreign dictators.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nMr. Webster, in an interview, said a longstanding Presidential executive order barring American involvement in assassinations had been interpreted to prohibit American assistance to any coup that could lead to the death of a country's leader, even in the heat of battle.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAsked if he would like to see this interpretation relaxed, Mr. Webster said, ''I don't think you're misreading me.''\r\n<br>\r\n...\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAdministration officials said that when the dissident Panamanian officers said this month that they were plotting a coup, C.I.A. officers in Panama were essentially barred from providing advice because of the possibility that the coup might lead to the death of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the country's leader.\r\n<br>\r\n...\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe first executive order on intelligence, as approved by President Ford on Feb. 18, 1976, said, ''No employee of the United States Government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, political assassination.'' Mr. Bush was the Director of Central Intelligence at the time.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe order's provisions were significantly strengthened in 1978 by President Carter to say that ''no person employed by or acting on behalf of the United States Government shall engage, or conspire to engage, in assassination.'' President Reagan retained that language in 1981 after a sharp dispute among his intelligence advisers.\r\n<br>\r\n...\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nMr. Webster, a former Federal judge, gave a detailed analysis of how he believed the executive order was interpreted at present.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nWhat is unequivocally barred, he said, is an American-devised plan for the assassination of General Noriega.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n''Now the next thing is, hire a guy to kill Noriega or fund a group who wants to kill Noriega,'' he said. ''Our executive order would have in the past been construed at least that we could not do that, because we would just be using someone else to do what we couldn't do ourselves.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n''Now it begins to get a little tighter when you say, 'Here's a group that says it doesn't plan to kill him, but they're going to have to play rough and it could happen.'\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n''Now we're in the area that has to be addressed.''\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn the interview, Mr. Webster said the C.I.A.'s assessment of the Panamanian coup leader, Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega, had concluded that he was a legitmate plotter whose plan was faulty and had less than a 50-50 chance of success. He acknowledged that the military's analysis of the situation placed greater emphasis on the possibility that Major Giroldi was part of an operation intended to entrap American military forces.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nWhen President Bush's senior advisers met on Oct. 2 to consider how to handle the coup, they concluded that it was best to proceed cautiously, largely because of the danger that Major Giroldi was not credible. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney represented the military. The C.I.A. was not included in the session.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAsked whether his agency should have been represented, Mr. Webster replied, ''That would have been the preferred option.'' But he said it made no difference in the outcome, because the C.I.A. analysis also suggested the need for caution.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAn Administration official said future crises of this sort would be handled by the Deputies Committee, a panel of senior officials that includes Richard Kerr, the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="caption"><i>Pictured</i>, William Webster with George H.W.

850	Daniel Ortega elected as president for the second time	<div class="page" data-title="Re-election"></div>\r\n<p class="entry" style="width:460px;background-color:white;padding:9px;position:relative;left:-10px;">\r\nDaniel Ortega elected as president for the second time, this time under very different circumstances.\r\n<br>\r\nUpon his inauguration as Nicaraguan president in January 2007, Daniel Ortega asserted that his government would represent “the second stage of the Sandinista Revolution.” His election was full of symbolic resonance, coming after 16 years of electoral failures for Ortega and the party he led, the Sandinista Front for National Liberation (FSLN). The Sandinistas’ road to power was paved with a series of previously unthinkable pacts with the old somocista and Contra opposition. The FSLN’s pact making began in earnest in 2001, when, in the run-up to that year’s presidential election, Ortega forged an alliance with Arnoldo Alemán, an official during the Somoza regime who had been elected president in 1997.\r\n<br>\r\nBut even with Alemán’s backing, Ortega was unable to win the presidency. So, before the 2006 election, he publicly reconciled with his old nemesis, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, a potent symbol of the counterrevolutionary movement in the 1980s. Ortega and his longtime companion, Rosario Murillo, announced their conversion to Catholicism and were married by the cardinal. Just before his election Ortega supported a comprehensive ban on abortion, including in cases in which the mother’s life is endangered, a measure ratified by the legislature with the crucial votes of Sandinista deputies. To round out his pre-election wheeling and dealing, Ortega selected Jaime Morales, a former Contra leader, as his vice presidential candidate.\r\n<br>\r\nOrtega's political strategy includes targeting the dissident party Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS), cofounded by Dora María Tellez, former Minister of Health and legendary Sandinista commander.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Zoilamerica"></div>\r\n<table><tr><td>\r\n<p class="entry" style="width:350px;background-color:white;padding:9px;">\r\nIn 1998, Ortega's then 30-year-old stepdaughter, Zoilamerica Narvaez (née Ortega), <i>pictured</i>, publicly declared that during the years of his 1979-1990 presidency, while he was pursuing his socialist ideals for a better world and fighting the contra guerrillas backed by the United States, he was also sexually abusing her, a child he had adopted and raised as his own. ''I was constantly being warned that, if I said anything to anyone, I could jeopardize the revolution,'' she said. ''I was told that keeping this situation a secret was the way I contributed to the stability of the presidency. I was blackmailed all the time and I assumed that my role was to suffer and to keep silent.''\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Narvaez said the abuse began in 1978, the year she turned 11. The Sandinistas were in rebellion against the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza Debayle, and the family had moved to Costa Rica to protect their lives.\r\n<br>\r\nThe abuse, she said, continued after the Sandinistas took power in 1979, and it went on until 1990, the year Mr. Ortega was voted out of power and she married Mr. Bendana, who had been the Sandinistas' envoy to the United Nations. Verbal abuse, including almost nightly sexual propositions, went on until 1998.\r\n</td><td>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/zoilamericanarvaez-crop.jpg">\r\n</td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</p>\r\n	2006	2006	1	58	<span style="color:white;">Counterpunch's The Betrayal of the Sandinista Revolution by ROGER BURBACH, the New York Times</span>	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:53.894633	2015-02-13 04:07:53.894633	\N
851	Sandinistas dominate the municipal elections	<p class="entry columns">\r\n2008 <br>\r\nSandinistas dominate the municipal elections. Many of the Sandinista mayors who were elected are critics of president Daniel Ortega, who has formed alliances with conservatives, signed new accords with the International Monetary Fund that do not modify the neoliberal paradigm (while the salaries of government workers remain frozen and those of teachers and health workers are the lowest in Central America), and punished feminist organizations fighting for women's reproductive rights.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the election, militant demonstrations erupted in Nicaragua’s two largest cities, Managua and León, and were quickly put down with violence. The European Economic Community and the U.S. government suspended funding for Nicaragua over the fraudulent elections. On January 14, before the election results were even officially published by the electoral council, Ortega swore in the new mayors at Managua’s Plaza de la Revolución. He declared: “This is the time to strengthen our institutions,” later adding, “We cannot go back to the road of war, to confrontation, to violence.” Along with the regular police, Ortega stood flanked by camisas rosadas, or redshirts, members of his personal security force. A huge banner hung over the plaza depicting Ortega with an up-stretched arm and the slogan, “To Be With the People Is to Be With God.”\r\n<br>\r\n“This despotic regime is bent on destroying all that is left of the Sandinista revolution’s democratic legacy,” Carlos Fernando Chamorro, the onetime director of the Sandinista party newspaper, told NACLA. “Standing in the way of a new dictatorship,” he continued, “are civil society organizations, the independent media, trade unions, opposition political parties, women’s organizations, civic leaders and others—many of whom can trace their roots back to the resistance against Somoza.”\r\n</p>	2008	2008	7	57	Et Tu, Daniel?

854	Expanded Military Presence	<p class="entries columns">\r\nDuring World War II, the United States maintained as many as 63,000 troops in Panama and forced through an agreement to establish more than 100 military bases outside the Canal Zone in the interior of Panama, ostensibly to defend the canal. Some of these troops, however, were deployed for a project to test chemical weapons to see how they would behave in a tropical environment, in preparation for an anticipated chemical war with the Japanese in the Paciﬁc. From late 1943 through 1947, the army’s Chemical Warfare Service used San José Island – an unpopulated member of the Pearl Islands group – to ﬁre or drop thousands of chemical munitions. The San José Project used soldiers, many of them Puerto Rican, as human subjects in the tests, exposing them to mustard gas and other agents to measure how well masks and ointments functioned and even, in one case, “to determine whether any difference existed in the sensitivity of Puerto Rican and Continental U.S. Troops to H gas [mustard].”\r\n<br>\r\nSimilarly, the United States dramatically expanded its military presence in Puerto Rico in the period leading up to and during World War II, establishing the vast Roosevelt Roads Naval Station and expropriating lands for the bombing ranges and maneuver area on the islands of Vieques and Culebra (the latter already in use as a ﬁring range) . In fact, U.S. military facilities, especially airﬁelds, were established during the war in many nations throughout much of the hemisphere (Ecuador, Peru, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and in several British colonies in the Caribbean), an observation that bears comparison with the current growth of U.S. bases around the world in the “war on terror.”\r\n<br>\r\n After the war, most of the U.S. bases in the region that had been set up for the war were closed, but the navy kept its bases in Puerto Rico.\r\n</p>	1943	1947	1	\N	U.S. MILITARY BASES IN LATIN  AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN John Lindsay-Poland	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:53.933566	2015-02-13 04:07:53.933566	\N

The vessel in question was the Hope of New London, Connecticut, which limped into port at the Caribbean island of St. Thomas after a harrowing voyage from West Africa. Explaining the death of Captain Gould and two seamen, the surviving sailors described a deadly slave revolt that they said occurred while the Hope was still on the Senegal coast. According to the crew, the forty-three slaves on board at the time suddenly revolted as the vessel was weighing anchor to sail to the nearby island of Goree. In the ensuing fight, the Africans managed to kill the captain and two of his crew before anyone had time to react. However, the rebels then made the fateful mistake of fleeing below deck, where the remainder of the sailors were quickly able to confine them and put an end to the deadly incident. After order was restored. the Hope finally managed to leave the African coast bound for the West Indies, this time under the watch of a new commander, George Taggart, who replaced the fallen Gould. However. the passage was not to be a smooth one, for at some point during the voyage the slaves rose once again, this time killing the ship's carpenter. The crew opened fire on the rebelling slaves, killing seven or eight and thus ending the insurrection. Finally, after the remaining Africans had been placed in double irons to avoid a third rebellion, the vessel made its way to St. Thomas, and the troubled slaving voyage of the Hope came to an end.\r\n<br><font style="font-size:smaller;">&emsp;\r\nA note about the background painting: "<i>Slavers Overthrowing the Dead and Dying-­ Typho[on]n Coming On</i>" (1840), the artist painted his picture specifically for an anti-slavery campaign, and in the left distance the beholder observes the guilty vessel about to meet its deserved end, while in the right and central foreground he encounters thrust upon him slaves being devoured by the sea and its creatures.

855	The Failed  Multinational Counter-narcotics Center	<p class="entries columns">\r\nIn 1995, Washington opened discussions with Panama to retain military bases in Panama beyond 1999 for a complex \r\nthat would be called a Multinational Counter-narcotics Center. At its core, the United States sought the continued use of Howard Air Force Base for surveillance missions of the Andean countries and eastern Paciﬁc.\r\n<br>\r\nPanamanian president Ernesto Pérez Balladares showed ambivalence toward the project from the beginning, saying there \r\nwould be no bases without payment of rent. The “multinational” nature of the complex was largely a ﬁg leaf designed to appease Panamanian nationalist sympathies; officials said other Latin American governments would participate in the center, but they were never involved in the negotiations. While Washington went through several negotiators, Panamanian nationalist, human rights, and environmental groups organized coalitions to oppose the continued presence of U.S. troops. They agitated in the media, on the street, and in the ruling Revolutionary Democratic Party against the negotiations. U.S. and Panamanian officials announced an agreement in December 1997, but when its details were leaked the following month, support for it evaporated. The agreement called for unpaid use of extensive facilities in the canal area, U.S. jurisdiction for crimes committed by U.S. soldiers, and a provision allowed for “other missions” besides counter-drug activity. The deal collapsed, and the United States would have to find new sites.\r\n</p>	1995	1997	1	\N	U.S. MILITARY BASES IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN John Lindsay-Poland	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:53.946334	2015-02-13 04:07:53.946334	\N
856	The Killing of Orlando Letelier and Ronni Moffitt	<p class="entry columns3">On September 21, 1976, a squad organized by the Chilean secret police assassinated Orlando Letelier, who had been Allende's ambassador to the United States and foreign minister, by detonating a bomb in his car as he drove near Dupont Circle in Washington.<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/orlandoleteliercar.jpg">\r\n<br>\r\nHis American assistant, Ronni Moffitt, was also killed. No such act of political terror had ever been committed in Washington, and it set off long and bitter condemnation of Pinochet's regime. Later it became clear that Letelier's murder was part of Operation Condor, a wider program to kill dissidents who were active outside of their home countries in Latin America.\r\n<br>\r\nFilmmaker Saul Landau: <i>My two colleagues, Orlando Letelier and Ronni Moffitt were assassinated in Washington, D.C., by Cuban exiles working for the Chilean secret police now. [H]e had been the Chilean ambassador in Washington. That’s where I first met him. And I had invited him to come to the Institute for Policy Studies, where I was working. And he did. And he wasn’t even there a year, and he was blown up in his car on Sheridan Circle, three-quarters of a mile from the White House—very audacious act of terrorism.\r\n<br>\r\n I had dinner with him on Sunday night. He was killed on Tuesday morning. And on that Sunday night, we had come out—my wife and I had come out of his house, and I remember talking outside with our elbows on his car, which was parked in the driveway, not knowing, of course, there was a bomb underneath the car.\r\n[A]ccording to the witnesses who later testified, they had put the car on late Saturday night—actually, early Sunday morning. They had placed the bomb on the car then.\r\n[T]hey missed him Monday somehow, and so they got him on Tuesday.\r\n<br>\r\nThe assassins came from a Cuban group in northern New Jersey, in Weehawken, called the Cuban Nationalist Movement. Sometimes they went under the name of Omega 7. And the FBI had infiltrated them and knew from early on in their investigation that they had been the actual perps who did the thing, under the auspices of the Chilean secret police, who had ordered the assassination.\r\n<br>\r\n[A]ccording to what we know from the FBI agents and from the FOIA stuff, they found out afterwards. The assassination was on a Tuesday. I think Friday or Saturday their informant called up and said that it was the Cuban Nationalist Movement who did the job, and then he named the people who did it: Guillermo Novo Sampol and his brother Ignacio and Alvin Ross and José Dionisio Suárez. They were all arrested by the FBI very quickly and held in contempt for refusing to testify. Then they were tried and convicted, three of them. And two later were caught and convicted. But then the Novos got out, because the prosecutor made a procedural error. And in the second trial, their lawyers apparently learned more than the prosecutors, and they got off. And it was at that point Guillermo Novo, in the hall, just right after the trial, looked at me and then, in Spanish, he said, "And now we’re going to get the rest of those commie SOBs." </i>\r\n<br>\r\nArmando Fernandez Larios, a member of a Chilean military squad responsible for the torture and execution of at least 72 political prisoners in the month following the 1973 coup, is now residing in the United States. Fernandez has publicly acknowledged his service as a member of the military squad, as well as his role as an agent of Chile's notorious secret police, the DINA, during the Pinochet regime. He struck a plea bargain with US government prosecutors, pleading guilty to being an "accessory after the fact" in the DINA-sponsored 1976 Washington, DC bombing murder of former Chilean dissident official Orlando Letelier. The Chilean government reportedly would like Fernandez extradited from the US, but his lawyer in Miami has said that the 1987 plea-agreement between his client and the Department of Justice stipulated that Fernandez would never be returned to Chile. Department of Justice officials have declined to comment on the degree of Fernandez's protection under the terms of the agreement, which is under court seal. Michael Townley of Chile played an even more significant role in the Letelier assassination. He served some time in a US prison and is now in the Federal Witness Protection Program.</p>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n"In such a context, concentration of wealth is no accident, but a rule; it is not the marginal outcome of a difficult situation&#8212;as they would like the world to believe&#8212;but the base for a social project; it is not an economic liability but a temporary political success. Their real failure is not their apparent inability to redistribute wealth or to generate a more even path of development (these are not their priorities) but their inability to convince the majority of Chileans that their policies are reasonable and necessary. In short, they have failed to destroy the consciousness of the Chilean people. The economic plan has had to be enforced, and in the Chilean context that could be done only by the killing of thousands, the establishment of concentration camps all over the country, the jailing of more than 100,000 persons in three years, the closing of trade unions and neighbourhood organizations, and the prohibition of all political activities and all forms of free expression."\r\n<br>\r\nOrlando Letelier, <A href="http://historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/letelierchicagoboys.html" class="inline">"The Chicago Boys in Chile: Economic Freedom's Awful Toll,"</a> <i>The Nation</i>, August 28, 1976\r\n\r\n</p>	1976	1976	1	107		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:53.95477	2015-02-13 04:07:53.95477	\N
857	The Caffeinated Modernizing El Salvador	<p class="columns">The history of modern El Salvador begins in a cup of\r\ncoffee. A new elite of exporters and bankers were determined\r\nto make their country the coffee center of Central America,\r\nand with the election of one of their own, President Zaldivar,\r\nin 1876, they began in earnest. On the grounds that neither\r\nthe Indian communities nor the country's municipalities were\r\nmaking efﬁcient use of their common lands, the would-be\r\ncoffee magnates pressured the government to eliminate all\r\nforms of landholding that were not in private hands. The\r\ngovernor of San Vicente province wrote in 1879: “The majority of these farmers do not wish to change their way of\r\nlife or to make progress because of the deep-rooted customs,\r\ntheir lack of ﬁnancial resources and their ignorance about\r\nthe great advantages of coffee cultivation.”\r\n<br>\r\nShortly thereafter, in 1881, the government simply decreed that the common lands, which had endured throughout the colonial period and after, would be no more. It passed legislation to control and recruit the dispossessed for work on the coffee ﬁncas, appointed agricultural judges who kept lists of day workers on the estates, and ordered their capture if they left before they completed their duties.\r\n<br>\r\nNew laws permitted landowners to evict squatters, forcing them to rent or wander landless. On most estates the landlords kept a few workers—<i>colonos</i>—to tend the farms between harvests, sometimes for pay, sometimes for room\r\nand board.\r\n<br>\r\nBut so radical a change in so short a time risked upheaval. Campesino revolts broke out in 1880, 1885, and 1898.\r\nTo ensure their control the coffee barons urged the build-up of the army. In 1900 a military training school was\r\nopened. In 1912 the government created a special security force exclusively to maintain order and to enforce the landlord's law in the rural areas, the <i>Guardia Nacional </i>(National\r\nGuard).\r\n<br>\r\nWith the dawn of the new century, the communal lands\r\nwere but a memory and the Guard-imposed peace reigned\r\nthroughout the land. A public relations tract on El Salvador\r\nin 1916 proclaimed:<br>\r\n<i>\r\nOne of the great obstacles that our agriculture was\r\nconfronted with was the deplorable system under\r\nwhich the national land was divided into </i>ejidos<i> and\r\n</i>tierras comunales<i> [communal lands], which caused\r\nland and labour to remain unused . . . . now the\r\nlandscape presents to the traveller a scene similar\r\nto a vast chessboard where the various products of\r\nthe fertile land may be admired; from the highest\r\npeaks to the beautiful valleys and plains, Salvador\r\npresents a view that reminds us of a large and well-\r\nkept garden, with every available piece of land being\r\nunder cultivation.</i>\r\n<br>\r\nSixty years later, here are a few facts about life in the "large and well-kept gardens":<br>\r\n<i>Two percent of the population controls 60 percent of the land; In 1975, 58 percent of the population earned $10/month or less; 70 percent of the children under five years of age are malnourished; The per capita calorie consumption rate is the lowest in the western hemisphere.

Nor is it credible that any one should possess so little understanding as to desire the faith and yet be destitute of the most necessary faculty to enable him to receive it. Hence Christ, who is the Truth itself, that has never failed and can never fail, said to the preachers of the faith whom He chose for that office 'Go ye and teach all nations.' He said all, without exception, for all are capable of receiving the doctrines of the faith.\r\n<br>\r\nThe enemy of the human race, who opposes all good deeds in order to bring men to destruction, beholding and envying this, invented a means never before heard of, by which he might hinder the preaching of God's word of Salvation to the people: he inspired his satellites who, to please him, have not hesitated to publish abroad that the Indians of the West and the South, and other people of whom We have recent knowledge should be treated as dumb brutes created for our service, pretending that they are incapable of receiving the Catholic Faith.\r\n<br>\r\nWe, who, though unworthy, exercise on earth the power of our Lord and seek with all our might to bring those sheep of His flock who are outside into the fold committed to our charge, consider, however, that the Indians are truly men and that they are not only capable of understanding the Catholic Faith but, according to our information, they desire exceedingly to receive it.

859	The First Conquistador Conquered by the Indians	<p class="entry columns">\r\n\r\n\r\nGonzalo Guerrero, a Spaniard from the little town of Niebla, on the Río Tinto, about twenty miles upriver from Palos, had accompanied Diego Colón to the Indies in 1509. He seems to have been literate. Bored with life in Santo Domingo, he set off with Diego de Nicuesa for the South American mainland. He was shipwrecked. Saved from being fattened and eaten, he and Jerónimo de Aguilar, who later became Cortés's interpreter, settled down in Yucatán. Guerrero found a Mayan girl, by whom he had several children. He was a slave, but all the same, he became a military adviser to Na Chan Can, the cacique in Chetumal. Fray Diego Landa thought that he taught the Indians "how to fight, showing them how to build fortresses and bastions." \r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuerrero was said to have advised the Maya to attack Hernández de Córdoba in 1517. In 1519, he had refused to return to Spanish life, as Jerónimo de Aguilar did, saying to him, "Brother Aguilar, I am married and have three children, the Indians treat me as a chief and as a captain in war. You go [back] and God be with you but I already have my face tattooed and my ears pierced.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/gonzaloguerrero.jpg" class="floatleft">\r\n\r\nWhat would the Spaniards say if they saw me in this guise?

Guerrero's Maya companion said to Aguilar, "Be off with you and don't give us any more trouble." \r\n<br>\r\nLong afterward, Gonzalo Guerrero falls defending another country, fighint besides other brothers, the brothers he chose.

Never read by its intended recipient, the letter was essentially forgotten until unearthed in 1908 in a\r\nDanish archive.\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Your Majesty, in your great goodness you have always charged your\r\nviceroys and prelates, when they came to Peru, to look after our Indians\r\nand show favor to them, but once they disembark from their ships\r\nand set foot on land, they forget your commands and tum against us.\r\nOur ancient idolatry and heresy was due only to our ignorance of the\r\ntrue path.

But it is the Christians who still adore property,\r\ngold and silver as their idols.</i>\r\n<br>\r\nGuaman Poma's vast 1,100-page <i>New Chronicle and Good Government of Peru</I> contains a detailed account of Inka-era social organization. It is unique for its over 300 drawings  and for its provincial's-eye viewpoint. Guaman Poma retells the lore of his "Yarovilca Allauca Huanuco" ancestors as well as giving an exceptionally full Inka history notable for its coverage of Inka 'queens' (coyas) and 'princesses' (nustas). He did not live to see his work read much. He was considered an eccentric and troublemaker in his own time, and when, in impoverished old age, he brought his New Chronicle and Good Government of Peru (probably finished in 1613 or 1615) to Lima, no Spanish official endorsed it. It gathered dust unread until 1908, when Richard Pietschmann found it in the Royal Library of Copenhagen.\r\n<br>\r\n<span class="bigquote" style="font-size:1em;">The Spaniards' insatiable appetite for precious metals baffled the Inka, who regarded cloth as a more valuable commodity. In one telling exchange illustrated by Guaman Poma, a native asks a Spaniard whether he ate gold.

This was the same year in which the Spanish king repealed all the laws protecting the Indians which had been passed only four years before through the work of Bartholomeo de las Casas, and the year in which Yucatan was finally conquered. In Yucatan, Landa lived many years building churches and monasteries, preaching, converting and became one of the first Franciscans to live among the Mayas, learning to speak their language and taking extensive notes about their culture. He was elected head of the Franciscan Order in Yucatan and then, in 1562, launched an elaborate inquisition in the town of Mani, torturing thousands and killing more than one hundred in an effort to get them to confess to human sacrifice and other sins. Convinced that the Mayan spiritual traditions were the work of the devil,<b> in July 1562, Landa burned eight centuries of ancient Mayan literature</b>: five thousand native religious images and at least twenty-seven painted books filled with hieroglyph-like images relating to their traditional religious practices and beliefs. Only four pre-Columbian codices, containing rare examples of Mayan writing, survived.\r\n<br>\r\nBishop Francisco de Toral finally stopped Landa's inquisition and sent him back to Spain, where, in 1564, he was tried for his excesses. He was eventually absolved of any misdeeds.\r\n<br>\r\nAs he waited for his case to be resolved, Landa wrote <i>Relacion de las Cosas de Yucatan</i>, now considered an authority on Mayan customs and language. The book would not be published for another three hundred years, but in the 20th century, Landa's work provided a valuable record and important clues for modern day scholars trying to decipher Mayan writing.\r\n<bt>\r\nAfter Toral's death, Landa was sent back to the New World in 1573 and was ordained Bishop of the Yucatan, a position he held until his death at age 54.</p>\r\n<p class="caption"><i>left</i>, Mural by Fernando Castro Pacheco: The Spanish bishop Diego de Landa burning figures of Mayan deities.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>	1562	1564	3	54	Open Veins of Latin America, Eduardo Galeano	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.000807	2015-02-13 04:07:54.000807	\N
863	Closing a Distance	<p class ="entry columns3">\r\nThe transportation revolution in Latin America meant, above all, steamships and railroads. Wooden sailing ships were at the mercy of fickle winds, and they carried less cargo than the iron-hulled steamships that gradually replaced them. Steamers plowed the waves faster and more reliably than did sailing ships. Steam-powered trains would eventually transform overland transportation, which had relied principally on pack mules or oxcarts. In general, mules and carts limited profitable export agriculture to the coastal plains. Railroads cost a lot to build, but once built, opened access to enormous areas, creating agricultural boomlets in practically every locality along the length of their tracks. As if steam were not enough, telegraph lines, able to transmit written messages instantaneously, introduced another nineteenth-century technological wonder—electricity. Stringing wires was easier than laying rails, blasting tunnels, and erecting bridges, so telegraph lines often outran train tracks. By 1874 a transatlantic telegraph cable had already been laid across the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean connecting Brazil to Europe.\r\n<br>\r\nNew technology transformed Latin America’s hazardous, unpredictable, and expensive communications with the rest of the world. That world would soon come to call, and elite Latin Americans, for whom Europe remained a cultural beacon, began to feel nervous at the prospect. After all, the “decent people” claimed social priority because of their European race and culture. But how would they measure up in the presence of the real thing? Would Europeans smirk at the “decent people’s” attempts to imitate them? Would they find Latin American countries devoid of <i>Progress</i>?\r\n<br>\r\nProgress (with a capital P) was the great theme of the West in the nineteenth century. The industrial and transportation revolutions had massively reordered societies and touched everyone’s lives in one way or another. Even when people suffered as a result, they stood in awe of the change. Somehow, the idea of inevitable, all-conquering technological advancement—a notion still with us today—had already taken hold of people’s imaginations. Here was a new hegemonic idea to replace the old colonial version. In a world where Progress seemed unstoppable, well-informed elite Latin Americans wanted to be part of it. Like other ruling classes in the West, they worried about modern materialism eroding traditional values, but they embraced materialism anyway. Exporting some thing for pounds sterling or dollars or francs was the obvious way to satisfy their desire to be up-to-date in European terms.\r\nExport earnings, after all, could buy fence wire and sewing machines and steam engines. In other words, export earnings\r\ncould literally import Progress, or so the elite believed.\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mid-1800s, Progress was becoming a sort of secular religion, and liberals were its prophets. Back in 1810, their vision of progress had a political emphasis: republics, constitutions, elections. As it turned out, that kind of progress bogged down in a morass of conflicting interests.\r\n<br>\r\nTechnological progress, on the other hand, still had an invincible reputation, and Latin American liberals reaped the benefits of the idea’s awesome persuasiveness. The years 1850—1875 saw a political sea change all across Latin America as the inevitability of Progress became simple common sense for the educated elite. People continued to follow caudillos and patrons. Economic interests still collided. But everywhere in Latin America, the liberals gained advantage by riding the wave of the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="caption"><i>Background</i>, a section of transatlantic cable.</p>\r\n\r\n	1874	1874	1	16	Born in blood and fire: a concise history of Latin America by John Charles Chasteen	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.014514	2015-02-13 04:07:54.014514	\N
865	Benito Juarez and his Law	<div class="page" data-title="Benito Juarez"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">When Mexican liberals began their great mid-century uprising—the beginning of an entire period called the Reform—the president was once again the old caudillo Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, who had worked overall to keep things from changing for a generation. Santa Anna finally left for exile in 1855. If Santa Anna represents Mexican politics as usual in the early post independence era, the liberals who gathered against him represent an alternative Mexico. At their head was Juan Alvarez, a tough mestizo caudillo from the tangled mountains of indigenous southern Mexico. Alvarez had been a patriot since the 1810s, when Santa Anna was still a royalist. Now an old man, and not much of a politician, Alvarez became the figurehead president after the departure of Santa Anna. But the real liberal crusaders of mid-century were younger men, educated men of words and laws. One was Melchor Ocampo. Like Alvarez, Ocampo was a mestizo, a man of humble background but extraordinary talent—an amateur scientist, economist, linguist, dramatist, and professional lawyer. Ocampo exemplifies a particular kind of liberal leadership—young, urban, mestizo, upwardly mobile men for whom progress offered personal advancement. Benito Juarez, the first person of fully indigenous ancestry to become governor of a Mexican state, likewise provides an atypical, but highly symbolic, example.\r\n<br>\r\nJuarez, like Ocampo, was an orphan with nowhere to go in life but up. At the age of twelve, he tired of watching over his uncle’s sheep in the mountains, left his Zapotec village, and traveled to the provincial city of Oaxaca, where his sister worked as a cook. There he put on European clothes (becoming famous, in fact, for the relentless formality of his black frock coat), perfected his Spanish, and eventually studied law at Oaxaca’s new public Institute of Arts and Sciences, which existed thanks to Mexico’s post independence liberal government. Juarez then practiced law in Oaxaca, at one point representing poor villagers against a supposedly abusive priest, a case that landed Juarez in jail for a few days. Eventually, he was elected to the state legislature and national congress and served five years as governor of Oaxaca. But Juarez left his Zapotec identity behind when he donned his black frock coat. He did not represent the interests of the Zapotecs in particular, or of indigenous people as a group. To call him an indio was to insult him, and he sometimes used rice powder to lighten his dark complexion. Yet everyone in Oaxaca—and, one day, all Mexicans—knew where Benito Juárez came from. His enemies might call him “a monkey dressed up as Napoleon,” but to many Mexicans, the personal rise of Benito Juarez confirmed the promise of liberalism.\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Law"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\n\r\n Among the first decrees of the liberal Reform was the Juarez Law (1855), which attacked military and ecclesiastical fueros and thrust its author into the national limelight. A couple of months later, the liberals decreed the Lerdo Law (1856), abolishing collective landholding. The Lerdo Law struck primarily at the church, which would now have to sell off its vast properties, but its secondary effect was to jeopardize the communal lands of indigenous villages. The Reform credo enshrined individual effort, property, and responsibility. According to the liberals, distributing village lands to individual families as private property would motivate each family to work harder because of the selfishness inherent in human nature. But indigenous villagers had their own vision,and they believed that communal lands benefited them. For that reason some indigenous villagers joined the “decent people” and other conservatives under the banner of “Religion and Fueros” and opposed the liberal Reform of the 1850s. \r\n<br>\r\nThe Reform lasted for only a few years before a conservative general seized the presidency and dissolved Congress in 1858. A full-scale civil war then erupted. Fleeing toward the liberal strongholds in the mestizo mining towns of the Mexican north, the reformers chose Benito Juárez to command their forces. They chose well, because even those who disliked Juárez respected his determination. The conservatives controlled most of the army, but the liberals now enjoyed widespread popular support. The Juarez government soon retook Mexico City, but the liberals’ troubles were not over. The civil war had bankrupted the Mexican state, and Juarez suspended payment on foreign debt. France, Spain, and Britain retaliated by collectively occupying Veracruz. At first, this occupation seemed simply another episode of gunboat diplomacy. The French, however, had an ulterior motive.\r\n<br>\r\n In desperation, defeated Mexican conservatives reached for their secret weapon: a monarch. Napoleon III of France wanted to expand French influence in Latin America.In fact, the French invented the name “Latin America” during these years as a way of making their influence seem natural. Before the mid-1800s, people had talked of Mexico or Brazil or Argentina, and also of “America,” but never of “Latin America.” Because French, like Spanish and Portuguese, is directly descended from Latin, the term “Latin America” implied a cultural kinship with France. Napoleon III obligingly supplied Mexican conservatives with a potential monarch obedient to French interests. The would-be emperor of Mexico, Maximilian, was a truly well-intentioned man from one of Europe’s greatest royal dynasties, the Hapsburgs. Before accepting the plan, Maximilian asked earnestly whether the Mexican peopie really wanted an emperor. Mexican conservatives falsely assured him that they did.</p>	1855	1858	8	55	Born in blood and fire: a concise history of Latin America by John Charles Chasteen	large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:54.024488	2015-02-13 04:07:54.024488	\N
866	Guano boom in Peru	<p class="entries columns" style="background-color: rgba(255,255,255,.5);">\r\nFormerly the mighty center of Spanish-speaking South America, its very name synonymous with silver, Peru had suffered a series of turbulent military caudillos in the wake of independence. But already in the 1840s, a new export product rescued Peruvian fortunes or, more precisely, the fortunes of the “decent people” of Lima. This product was <i>guano</i>, the old fertilizer from Inca days, seabird manure, that had accumulated for thousands of years on offshore islands, <i>pictured</i>,  where the birds nested. Easy—if not exactly pleasant—to mine, guano deposits stood in great mounds, waiting to be shoveled aboard ship, and European farmers could not get enough of the nitrogen-rich fertilizer. Guano export required substantial capital for ships, crews, installations, and shovel men, but British capitalists saw it as a safe investment. British guano exporters operated offshore, even bringing workers from China to keep the process totally under outside control. The Peruvian government, for its part, got a direct cut of the profits, usually more than half, because the guano islands were government property. As Peruvian export earnings doubled and doubled again, the formerly poverty-stricken national government had a bonanza on its hands.\r\n<br>\r\nGuano money immediately began to build one of Latin America’s first railroads. Lima got public gas lighting and other urban improvements, not to mention public jobs for the “decent people,” a kind of export-driven growth that became common in Latin America as a whole only half a century later. But now (or later), little of this prosperity reached the other Peru—the sierra, the Andean highlands that rise sharply behind Lima and the narrow coastal plain. Since the Peruvian government no longer depended on Andean silver or on the head tax paid by indigenous people of the sierra, it could afford to neglect that region. This, too, was a portent of the\r\nfuture.\r\n<i>Born in Blood and Fire by John Charles Chasteen</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entries columns3" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;position:relative;left:250px;top:-10px;width:800px;">\r\n\r\nIn the period between the Independence Wars (1820-1824) and the War of the Paciﬁc (1879-1883), the colonial legacy of hierarchy and division foreclosed a shared sense of Peruvian national identity. A tiny minority of European descent controlled land, power, and capital. The lower and bottom tiers of society were filled by the brown majorities. To be sure, neither the elite nor the underclasses were monolithic. Black slaves in lca's vineyards and orchards were descendants of West Africans brought in chains to Peru in the seventeenth century. Chinese laborers were indentured in the 1850s to dig guano from the rocky islands of\r\nParacas to ship as fertilizer to Europe. German colonists arrived at the century's close in the coffee-growing jungles of the Chanchamayo valley. Astute visitors, like French feminist Flora Tristan, understood that republican Peru was crosscut by differences along lines of political and religious conviction, gender, and ethnicity. In general, however, the society pivoted on the privilege of the wealthy and the European over the poor and  “uncivilized" races.The sharp-tongued nineteenth-century critic Manuel Gonzalez Prada compared the treatment of Peru's Indian majorities to that received by serfs under the boot of feudal lords.\r\n<br>\r\nInstability prevailed after independence. At least twenty-four regime changes erupted between 1825 and 1841, as ﬁerce disputes raged between rival warlords, or <i>caudillos</i>. From the late 1840s to the early 1870s, the Age of Guano brought a precarious consolidation. Exports of the bird dung from coastal islands reached more than $20 million a year by the mid-1850s, tightening Peru’s links to the world economy. Especially strong was the connection to the main imperial power of the age, Great Britain. Peru of the nineteenth century was marked by the arrival of a stream of British as well as French, Italian, and German travelers, officials, and investors. Foreign businessmen partnered the coastal oligarchy in Andean mines, railroads, and cotton and sugar plantations, as the cheap labor of blacks, Chinese, and Indians generated the enormous profits that filled the coffers of British and German companies and bankrolled the magnificent estates and European excursions of the creole elite.\r\n<br>\r\nThe Independence Wars were waged under the Enlightenment principles of equality of rights and economic man. Yet old colonial prejudices intersected with new “scientific” doctrines of racial “types” and hierarchies. Not all of these classifications were as virulent as that of the Lima intellectual who in 1891 decried the Andean Indians as “a degenerated, old branch of the ethnic trunk from which all inferior races emerged . . . with almost no mental life, apathetic, without aspirations.“ Plenty of Peruvians found their own means to challenge the regnant order, whether in sly jokes or angry revolts. Yet interlocking hierarchies of class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and color retained a persuasive power, the ideological foundations of a country where the denial of political representation and economic rights to the majorities reflected their effective exclusion from the “imagined community” of national citizenry. The depth of division was laid bare by the War of the Paciﬁc. Although guano deposits were a bonanza in the 1850s and 1860s, they were almost exhausted even before the conflict, and the mismanaged government went bankrupt in 1874.\r\n<i>The Peru Reader (DUKE)</i>\r\n</p>	1840	1849	5	65		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.032932	2015-02-13 04:07:54.032932	\N

103	Curaçao Revolt	<p class="entry columns" style="background:white;width:550px;">\r\nThe Dutch West Indies, which included Suriname and the “ABC islands” of Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, was frequently the site of organized slave resistance in the late eighteenth century. Due to the extent of the slave population and the limited number of colonial inhabitants in the region, rebellion had the potential for wreaking tremendous devastation upon the area.\r\n<br>\r\nOn August 17, 1795, slaves on the island of Curaçao in the Dutch West Indies launched an insurrection that lasted for one month before it was suppressed by colonial authorities. The rebellion was led by slaves named Tula Rigaud and Bastiaan Carpata. Up to 4000 Negro slaves on the Northwest section of the island revolted. Over a thousand of the slaves were involved in heavy gunfights and the Dutch feared for their lives. Colonial officials eventually used a force of free black militia to put down the insurrection.\r\n<br>\r\nIt is likely that inspiration for the rebellion in Curaçao apparently came from two independent outside sources. Slaves on the island were aware of the success that slave rebels in the French colony of Saint Domingue had experienced in their efforts to win freedom through the force of arms. In addition, news had reached Curaçao about the defeat of the Dutch by French revolutionary forces in Europe and the subsequent establishment of the Batavian Republic (1795). Rumors circulated on the island of Curaçao\r\nthat the Batavian Republic would initiate reforms akin to those that had been adopted by the French in their Constitution of 1794, reforms that would likely abolish slavery throughout the Dutch West Indies.\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dutch moved colonial troops from Suriname to Curaçao in order to suppress the revolt, and these included the Corps of Free Coloreds and Blacks. The black troops were especially employed to root out maroon settlements on the island of Curaçao that were suspected of being somehow complicit with the actions of the slave rebels.\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Tula and Carpata were tortured on the rack before they were put to death and made to confess the false charge that their true intention had been to kill all of the whites on the island. In the aftermath of the revolt, Dutch authorities made efforts to alleviate some of the harsher labor practices (e.g., working on Sundays) that had been contributing factors in causing unrest on Curaçao.\r\n</p>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/curacao.jpg" style="position:absolute;left:585px;top:40px;width:600px;">\r\n\r\n<!--  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cura%C3%A7ao1836.png -->	1795	1795	7	37	<i>Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion</i> edited by Junius P.

US Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge responded by giving his &quot;assurance [that] the United States has no aggressive purpose against Cuba.&quot; Four months before, in March 1960, his government had made a formal decision in secret to overthrow the Castro government, and preparations for the Bay of Pigs invasion were well advanced.\nWashington was concerned that Cubans might try to defend themselves. CIA chief Allen Dulles therefore urged Britain not to provide arms to Cuba. His &quot;main reason,&quot; the British ambassador reported to London, &quot;was that this might lead the Cubans to ask for Soviet or Soviet bloc arms,&quot; a move that &quot;would have a tremendous effect,&quot; Dulles pointed out, allowing Washington to portray Cuba as a security threat to the hemisphere, following the script that had worked so well in Guatemala.</p>	1960	1960	1	32	Hegemony or Survival Chomsky	medium	f	2015-02-13 04:07:54.083714	2015-02-13 04:07:54.083714	\N

763	"And What Does One Do With a Rabid Dog?"	<p class="entry columns3">\r\n<strong>Sept. 13, 1985 </strong><i>Beheaded body of Hugo Spadafora found near Costa Rican-Panama border.  </i>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/HugoSpadafora-small.jpg" class="floatleft">\r\n&emsp;The murder of Hugo Spadafora, one of the most flamboyant figures\r\nin modern Panamanian history, stunned a country where such crimes\r\nare all but unknown. Revulsion rose to a new level when the results of\r\nan autopsy on Spadafora's torso were released, showing that he had suffered\r\nthrough hours of unspeakable torture and that his head had been\r\nslowly severed while he was still alive. These facts alone, however, were\r\nhardly enough to rouse the United States into action. During the mid-\r\n1980s, senior American leaders, including President Ronald Reagan,\r\nvigorously supported military regimes in Guatemala and El Salvador,\r\nwhose troops carried out comparable crimes every day. What made the\r\nSpadafora murder such a crucial turning point in Panamanian history\r\nwas that it signaled the regime's slide into irrationality. That is a quality\r\nthe United States can tolerate in many of its allies but not one whose\r\ndomain is so close to the Panama Canal.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Noriega was at a dermatology clinic in Geneva when Spadafora was\r\nkilled, undergoing treatment that he hoped would repair his deeply\r\nscarred face. There he received an urgent telephone call from Major Luis\r\nCordoba, head of the unit that had captured Spadafora. Evidently neither\r\nman realized that American intelligence agents were eavesdropping.\r\n"We have the rabid dog in our hands," Major Cordoba told his\r\ncommander.<br>\r\n&emsp;"And what does one do with a rabid dog?" Noriega asked in reply.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;That was the go-ahead soldiers needed in order to begin the long night\r\nof torture that ended in Spadafora's decapitation.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;A year earlier, Noriega had directed an electoral fraud from which\r\nNicolas Ardito Barletta, a brilliant but colorless Chicago-trained economist,\r\nhad emerged as president of Panama. Now he demanded that Barletta\r\npublicly absolve him of involvement in the Spadafora murder.\r\nBarletta refused, and on September 27,1985, two weeks after the murder,\r\nNoriega forced him to resign. He left office with a prophetic warning.\r\n"Listen to me," Barletta told Noriega. "The day will come when you\r\nare sorry for what you are doing. Remember my words."\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;During this period, Noriega further endeared himself to the Reagan\r\nadministration by agreeing to help the Nicaraguan contras. While publicly\r\nmouthing platitudes about the need for peace and cooperation\r\namong Central American countries, he gave the contras invaluable\r\ncovert support. He welcomed their leaders in Panama, permitted the\r\nUnited States to train their fighters in secret at Panamanian bases, and\r\nturned a blind eye when the Americans began using Howard Air Force\r\nBase, in the Canal Zone, for clandestine flights carrying weapons to\r\ntheir bases along the Nicaragua-Honduras border.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;After Noriega forced President Barletta out of office, the American\r\nambassador in Panama, Everett Briggs, wanted to begin increasing\r\nAmerican pressure on him. His boss, Undersecretary of State Elliott\r\nAbrams, a vigorous supporter of the contras, overruled him. Two months\r\nlater, eager to learn firsthand what the United States thought of him,\r\nNoriega traveled to Washington to meet the CIA director, William\r\nCasey. Casey had been the chief architect of the contra project, and\r\nrather than reprimand Noriega or demand that he change his behavior,\r\nhe was downright friendly.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/noriegaangry-small.jpg" class="floatright">\r\n&emsp;At the end of 1985, the newly appointed national security adviser,\r\nAdmiral John Poindexter, came to Panama to meet with Noriega, and\r\nalthough according to some reports he was tougher than Casey had been,\r\nhe was not forceful enough to impress his host. The Reagan administration\r\nwas so obsessed with the idea of overthrowing the Sandinistas that\r\nit was ready to support even a scoundrel like Noriega as long as he continued\r\nto help the contras.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;As this became clear to Panamanian opposition figures, they began\r\nlooking for other ways to influence American policy. One of them, Winston\r\nSpadafora, a brother of the murdered dissident, flew to Washington\r\nand managed to persuade Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina,\r\nchairman of the Senate subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs,\r\nto hold hearings on Panama in the spring of 1986. A week before the\r\nfirst scheduled hearing, Abrams called Helms and asked him to cancel\r\nit. He said that Noriega was "being really helpful to us" and was "really\r\nnot that big a problem."</p>	1985	1985	10	104	Overthrow by Stephen Kinzer and ATinyRevolution blog	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.115187	2015-02-13 04:07:54.115187	\N
346	"<i>In this long war, with the camera<br> as our rifle, we do in fact move into a guerrilla activity.</i>"	<p class="entry columns3">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1969, Fernando Ezequiel Solanas (b. Buenos Aires, 1936), in collaboration with other Argentine filmmakers, filmed a chapter of Argentina, mayo de 1969: los caminos de la liberación. The film has never been restored in its entirety, and few have seen it. Nevertheless, it remains a legendary testimony to collective political unrest, particularly influential for its promotion of cinema as a new vehicle of protest against a ruling regime.\r\nSolanas’ filmic inspirations were not exclusively cinematic: his earlier studies in literature, music, dance and law led him to pursue theater arts at the Conservatory of Dramatic Arts (Conservatorio de Arte Dramático), where cinema would eventually seduce him. His career in cinema began at age 26, with the filming of Seguir andando (1962). Another short film, Reflexión ciudadana (1963), followed a year later. \r\nLike his friend Octavio Getino, Solanas was a Peronist, and in 1968 the two men directed the most influential political documentary of the era: La hora de los hornos: Notas y testimonios sobre el neocolonialismo, la violencia y la liberación. Divided into three parts, the 255-minute documentary managed to be many things at once: instrument of leftist political and social protest; manifesto; educational cinematic debate; essay of cultural interpretation of Latin America in general and of Argentina in particular; a filmic collage, collecting and juxtaposing fragments from other films of the period; active artifact in the democratization of images; unofficial history. It was also the most controversial film of the 1960s.  \r\n<br>\r\nSolanas and Getino also founded the Grupo Cine Liberación and developed the theory of “Third Cinema”: a cinema that is neither commercial nor authorial, emerging instead from the public at large. Meanwhile, the two kept in close contact with Juan Domingo Perón during his exile in Madrid (1955-1974), following his removal from power in the so-called Liberating Revolution (Revolución Libertadora). The relationship resulted in their 1971 film, Perón: Actualización política y doctrinaria para la toma del poder. \r\n<br>\r\nSolanas’ second full-length film, Los hijos de Fierro (1972), appropriated a well-known literary character in order to experiment with combining scenes of fiction and documentary. This innovation achieves an extremely personal reading of Martín Fierro, the classic “gauchesco” poem of 1872. Adding to the film’s unique ambition, much of the dialogue is written in the same octosyllabic meter as José Hernández’s poem. Given the poem’s fundamental role in Argentine culture, it becomes a poignant frame of reference and brilliant backdrop for a complex film that oscillates between epic and lyric, realist and mythic, allowing the poem’s “characters” and scenarios to articulate a political allegory of the 1970s in Argentina.  \r\nIn 1975, the military executed another coup d’etat in Argentina. The following year, Solanas went into exile. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<font style="display:none">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrupo Cine Liberacion, Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino, Cine Base Formed (1973), letters from Peron</font></p>	1967	1973	9	8		large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:54.12489	2015-02-13 04:07:54.12489	\N
97	"A Natural Extension"	<p class="entry ">On June 23, 1783, the second US president, John Adams, expressed what was to be the US's attitude towards Cuba until the end of the 19th century. He said the island was a natural extension of the North American continent, and that the continuation of the United States made its annexation necessary. The best way to achieve that, he reckoned, was to let Cuba to remain under Spanish rule until it could be seized directly, because independence could never to be allowed.</p>	1783	1783	1	32		small	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.133875	2015-02-13 04:07:54.133875	\N
651	The Harkin Amendment	<p class="entry columns3"><strong><i>The Harkin Amendment states foreign assistance won't be sent to governments with gross human rights violations.</i></strong><br>\r\n&emsp;During the final year of the Ford presidency, Nicaragua became one target of a growing U.S. Congressional focus on human rights abuses in the Third World, particularly by governments receiving American economic and military aid. The White House refusal to comply with non-binding legislation calling for the termination of military assistance programs to repressive allies failed to slow down the groundswell of legislative support for sanctions against offending regimes. Subsequently, Congress passed the Harkin amendment, legally mandating the executive branch to halt all economic aid to governments deemed guilty of a gross and consistent pattern of human rights violations. In May 1976, the amendment was extended to U.S. policy in the Inter-American Development Bank and the African Development Bank. U.S. representatives in these regional economic institutions were now required to vote against loan requests from designated human rights abusers except where the monies were intended to "directly benefit the poor." Congress also directed the Secretary of State to submit an annual report on the status of human rights in all countries receiving\r\nU.S. aid. Finally, legislative pressure was instrumental in the administration's decision to establish a human rights office in the State Department.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIrrespective of these Congressional demands for greater attention to human rights questions in the conduct of foreign policy, the overall Ford White House posture remained a mixture of reluctant accommodation, subtle resistance, and outright rejection. The major stumbling block was Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who exhibited a palpable lack of enthusiasm over the idea that morality had any, let alone a prominent, role to play in the making of foreign policy - and a President willing to defer to his Secretary's judgment on this issue. A senior Inter-American Affairs official summarized the basic approach:\r\n<span class="blockquote"><i>Ford policy remained essentially the Kissinger policy which basically placed considerably less emphasis on human rights issues and more on government stability and friendly relations. Governments supportive of the United States were basically viewed as good governments. The policy of the Kissinger period was to do what was necessary to satisfy\r\nCongress on human rights but not to take any measures to distance the U.S. from governments helpful to us.</i></span>\r\n&emsp;\r\nNeither the Harkin amendment nor the newly formed State Department's Office of Human Rights substantially interfered with this general policy line. In the multilateral development banks, the administration applied pressure to force postponements of final decisions on loan submissions from repressive Third World allies. "Our general tactic," an involved official observed, "was to get loan requests put off so we didn't have to vote either way." Meanwhile, Kissinger ensured that the Office of Human Rights was kept outside of the policymaking "loop." According to the Office's first coordinator James Morrison Wilson, he routinely ignored Office memorandums recommending greater attention to human rights factors in America's relations with autocratic governments. As a result, it wielded virtually no influence over Third World aid decisions.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nNot surprisingly, the Secretary was harshly critical of any subordinates who publicly diverged from his approach. In June 1976, for instance, Kissinger "laid out the administration's line" on human rights in an opening address to the Organization of American States which was meeting to consider the issue. In the debate that followed, comments by U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador Robert White "went a considerable way to specifically condemn Somoza and the Chilean dictator Pinochet." Kissinger was "outraged" and accused White of having "overstepped his instructions."</p>	1975	1975	1	74	Washington, Somoza, and the Sandinistas: State and Regime in U.S. Policy Toward Nicaragua, 1969-1981	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.140828	2015-02-13 04:07:54.140828	\N

In late 1917 the Immigration Service began requiring passports of all who wanted to cross from the United States into Mexico to limit the ability of individuals who were in the service of enemy governments to communicate with those governments. Such war-related hysteria, combined with the campaigning of\r\nthe growing reformist movement against the “vices” of Tijuana and the instability brought about by the Mexican Revolution, led to an official closing of the boundary by U.S. authorities in December 1917, a closing that remained in effect for two years. That\r\nsaid, even during the war, the ability of U.S. authorities to patrol the boundary was very limited. As of February 1918, for example, there were five immigration inspectors stationed in Calexico, one in Campo, and four in Tia Juana. As the Supervising Inspector\r\nof the Mexican Border District wrote at the time, the inspectors, given the myriad demands on their time, “are able to give but little attention to patrol duty.” And despite the nominal stationing of U.S. troops along the boundary at the time, it appears that their\r\nnumbers were very much insufficient. As the supervising inspector wrote about enforcement measures along the U.S.-Mexico boundary in general, “so long as the border is not adequately guarded, the restrictive measures employed at ports of entry simply tend to divert the illegal traffic to unguarded points, of which there are literally thousands.”\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n	1918	1918	1	106	OPERATION GATEKEEPER: THE RISE OF THE “ILLEGAL ALIEN” AND THE MAKING OF THE U.S.-MEXICO BOUNDARY by JOSEPH NEVINS	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.148854	2015-02-13 04:07:54.148854	\N

During his 1988 campaign, Bush was dogged by accusations that he knew more than he let on about Iran Contra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntest test test test test test test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test 0test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test\r\n<img src="/mapimages/cantseeyou.gif" class="floatleft" style="padding:10px; height: 231px; width: 123px;">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test1 testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test test\r\ntest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test 2test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test 3testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test4 testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test testtest test test test test\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</div>	1989	1989	1	74		large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:54.197274	2015-02-13 04:07:54.197274	\N

718	Noriega is named Commander of newly created Panamanian Defense Forces.	<p class="entry columns" style="padding:9px;background-color:white;width:608px;"><strong>1983</strong> General Noriega is named Commander of newly created Panamanian Defense Forces.\r\n<br> &emsp;He had twice attended the U.S. Army School of the Americas in the Panama Canal Zone and had been on the CIA payroll since the 1960s, despite knowledge by US drug authorities as early as 1971 that the general was heavily involved in drug trafficking and money laundering.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Corrupt and unscrupulous, he profited from assisting Colombia's Medellin drug cartel, hut he also fingered Medellin rivals to the\r\nU.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. His assistance to the contras in Nicaragua won him protection from top Reagan\r\nadministration officials, including William Casey, Elliott Abrams, and Oliver North. US officials, including CIA Director William Webster and several Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) officers, sent Noriega letters of praise for his efforts to thwart drug trafficking (albeit only against competitors of his Medellin Cartel patrons). \r\n<br>&emsp;In 1984, the CIA helped finance a highly questionable presidential electoral victory for one of Manuel Noriega's men. Because of a controversy in 1984—when NED funds were used to aid a Panamanian presidential candidate backed by Manuel Noriega and the CIA—Congress enacted a law prohibiting the use of NED funds "to finance the campaigns of candidates for public office."\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n<strong>So about that election....</strong><br>\r\n&emsp;In some cases. the State Department's National Endowment of Democracy has been instrumental in helping ease the transfer of power from military to civilian rule, but it has not consistently resisted military rule. In 1984. it funded the military-backed presidential candidate in Panama. Nicolás Ardito Barletta, a University of Chicago economics graduate who previously held no political office and who was widely regarded as a puppet of Panamanian strongman General Manuel Noriega, himself a U.S. ally at the time.<br>\r\n&emsp;Even without direct political experience, Barletta had other U.S.-approved credentials and sources of support. Before returning to Panama thaI year, he had been a vice president of the World Bank for six years. To help him in his electoral ambitions, the U.S. firm D. H. Sawyer and Associates supplied the word power (the theme of "new leadership") and other campaign expertise–what one writer called another example of "the age-old dream of exporting American democracy to the world." Sawyer's contact with\r\nBarletta had been arranged by Jimmy Carter's chief of staff, Hamilton Jordan.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Richard Dresner, who in the 1990s worked to get Boris Yeltsin elected in Russia, did Barletta's polling, even though he admitted knowing next to nothing about Panama. Census data on household television ownership and the addresses of voters were all that interested him. Dresner focused on TV ads and a direct-mail campaign. A former Israeli intelligence officer ran focus groups. The whole affair cost well beyond a million dollars, and Barletta won a narrow victory. but not without extensive vote count fraud\r\norganized by Noriega. Barletta was invited to the Reagan White House.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Why did the United States support a military-backed politician with so little political experience? In part, it was that Noriega, at the time a longtime CIA "asset," permitted Panama to be used as a training area for the Contras, the counterrevolutionary Nicaraguan exile group of the deposed Somoza dictatorship that the United States was supporting. Panama also trained Salvodoran\r\narmy officers to fight against the left-wing FMLN rebellion in that country. NED money was channeled in part to pro-Barletta unions through the AFL-CIO's Free Track Union Institute. NED's tactics succeeded–briefly.\r\nIn less than a year, Noriega forced Barletta out of office.\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Global Electioneering: Campaign Consulting, Communications, and Corporate Financing by Gerald Sussman</strong></p>	1983	1984	1	59	Rogue State by William Blum	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.214921	2015-02-13 04:07:54.214921	\N

In August, US Defense Attache Vernon Walters warned the Pentagon that Brazilian president João Goulart was promoting &quot;ultranationalist officers&quot; in preference to &quot;pro-democratic pro-US officers&quot; (the two terms presumably being synonymous). Relations harshened further under the Johnson Administration. Senator Albert Gore informed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, then considering US aid, that he had heard that &quot;all of the members of the Brazilian Congress who advocated the kind of reforms which we have made a prerequisite for Alliance for Progress aid are now in prison.&quot; Ambassador Gordon cabled Washington that the US should increase military aid for Brazil because the military was essential in the &quot;strategy for restraining left wing excesses of Goulart government.&quot; Meanwhile the CIA was &quot;financing the mass urban demonstrations against the Goulart government, proving the old themes of God, country, family, and liberty to be as effective as ever,&quot; Philip Agee noted in his Diary.\r\n<br>&emsp;<i>Pictured here</i> is João Goulart's April 1962 visit to the Kennedy White House.

One of the main problems in gaining recognition for these alliances is the difficulty of incorporating Guatemala. The first attempt, in August 1979, was the so-called Iron Triangle of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala; it faltered at that time for the dearth of any democratic credentials. Next came the "Strategic Triangle," in which more palatable countries–Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic and Colombia–were to be enlisted as pincer states, where U.S. troops would come and go freely. As Congress lagged on allocating funds for upgraded airstrips in these countries, a new idea was born: that of the Central American Democratic Community. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe Central American Democratic Community consisting of\r\nHonduras, Costa Rica and El Salvador was created in January\r\n1982. Its creation was a US maneuver to legitimize the elections\r\nin El Salvador, grant recognition to the "elected" regime, co-ordinate\r\naction to stimulate development of the private sector in each\r\ncountry, and provide the framework for the creation of an interventionist\r\nforce in the Central American area. Colombia, the United\r\nStates and Guatemala later became members of the Community.\r\nThe intention was to establish a political and military wall to isolate revolutionary Nicaragua.\r\nAs part of this encirclement scheme, Washington planned\r\nto establish naval and air bases on the island of Amapala in\r\nthe Gulf of Fonseca and on San Andres island in the Caribbean,\r\nboth of them within the continental shelf of Nicaragua.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nBut the Democratic Community\r\nquickly became a two-edged contradiction in\r\nterms when the Administration urged the inclusion\r\nof Guatemala.\r\n<br>&emsp; With the Malvinas-Falklands war, U.S.\r\nhopes for rehabilitating Guatemala took a real\r\nnose dive. Guatemala, identifying with its own\r\nlong-simmering claims to Belize, ardently took\r\nthe Argentine side, placing 350 paratroopers\r\nand marines on standby to be flown to Port\r\nStanley if needed.<br>&emsp; \r\nThe Argentine connection was nothing new.\r\nRelationships with the Southern Cone dictatorships\r\nhad long been a part of Guatemala's attempt\r\nto break out of international isolation by\r\njoining forces with other pariah nations. The\r\nLondon Guardian had reported the presence of\r\nArgentine and Chilean torture specialists in\r\nGuatemala under Lucas; others alleged that\r\nGuatemalan soldiers and police were taking\r\ncourses, including interrogation techniques,\r\nfrom Southern Cone mentors-200 in Argen-\r\ntina and another 175 in Chile." In the summer\r\nof 1981, sophisticated Argentine computer\r\nanalysis methods (using Israeli hardware) had\r\nbeen crucial in detecting 27 guerrilla safe houses\r\nin Guatemala City..<br>&emsp; \r\nOther sympathetic members of the "Pariah\r\nInternational" too have rallied to the Guatemalan\r\ncause: Apartheid South Africa, Taiwan, and Israel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	1982	1982	1	90		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.247436	2015-02-13 04:07:54.247436	\N
259	United Fruit and The US Military Fight the Honduran Civil War	<p class="entry columns" style="column-gap: 90px; -webkit-column-gap: 90px;"><span class="intro">U.S. Troops intervene in the Honduran Civil War, which has been provoked by the U.S.-owned United Fruit and Coyumel companies.</span>\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe small nations of Central America were dependent on one or two crops, and those crops were largely controlled by North American Investors.\r\nThe statistics are astounding: of Costa Rivas $18 million of exports in\r\n1929, $12 million came from coffee, $5 million from bananas. Of El\r\nSalvador's $18 million of exports, $17 million represented coffee and\r\nabout one million dollars, sugar. Of Guatemala's $25 million total exports, $19 million was in coffee and $3 million in bananas. Honduras\r\nexported $25 million worth of products; bananas accounted for $21\r\nmillion. Of Nicaragua's $11 million export trade, coffee represented $6\r\nmillion and bananas $2 million. Clearly if the prices of coffee and bananas suddenly dropped on international markets, all Central America\r\nwould plunge into disaster.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nMany U.S. investors would share in the disaster, for they had become\r\nparamount in Central America. Their direct investments in the area\r\nmore than doubled between 1919 and 1929 to $251 million. In Guatemala they (especially United Fruit) controlled all but a few miles of the\r\nrailroads, one-fifteenth of the total land area, the leading bank, a number\r\nof major industries, and the great utility company (American and Foreign Power owned by General Electric). In Honduras, United Fruit and\r\nits subsidiaries controlled the rail system, port facilities, and nearly all the banana and rubber-producing lands. North Americans owned the prosperous silver mine. In Nicaragua, United Fruit and Atlantic Fruit claimed 300,000 acres. North Americans owned and/or managed the leading mines, the railroads, the lumber industry, and banks. El Salvador's bonds were now handled by New York instead of British banks, its most important domestic financial institution was owned by San Francisco interests, and its transportation system depended on North American capital. U.S. investment had nearly caught up with British in Costa Rica, and the dominant company in the nation was unquestionably United Fruit. North Americans controlled railroads, mines, cables, and–thanks to Woodrow Wilson–oil concessions. Behind these dull statistics lay an economic empire of which few (aside, perhaps, from Minor Keith, whose power was matched only by his imagination) had dreamed a mere twenty years before. Always a genius in his timing, Keith died in 1929 just as disaster struck the system.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThis economic power was protected, and the politics of several of these small nations largely shaped, by the ever-present military forces of the United States. In Honduras, for example, U.S. troops had intervened six different times by 1925. At that point, North Americans were\r\nso dominant that they even fought each other. This embarrassment\r\noccurred after Tiburcio Carías Andino (later to be the most skillful of all\r\nHonduran dictators) lost a presidential election in 1923 that was obviously\r\nfixed by the incumbent Liberal party. Carías had taken care to win\r\nthe favor of United Fruit, and with the company's support launched a\r\nrevolt. The imaginative Carías even pioneered the use of aerial bombardment\r\nin Central America during the war. U.S. officials, however, had set\r\nthe ground rules for Honduras in 1911 and 1912, and the Washington\r\ntreaties of 1923 reaffirmed the rules. So U.S. troops landed in 1924 to\r\nprotect lives and property, and soon found themselves fighting against\r\nUnited Fruit's presidential nominee. When the conflict spread to areas\r\nwhere foreigners lived, the U.S. forces quickly smashed Carías's dreams\r\nof power. The 1923 treaties had been upheld. Sumner Welles then\r\nmediated, and a man acceptable to all sides became president. North\r\nAmerican power had become so encompassing that U.S. military forces\r\nand United Fruit could struggle against each other to see who was to\r\ncontrol the Honduran government, then have the argument settled by\r\nthe U.S. Department of State. But the story ended happily for Carías. In\r\n1929 United Fruit bought out Sam Zemurray's Cuyamel Fruit Company,\r\nand since Cuyamel had bought and paid for the Liberal party–Carías's\r\npolitical enemy–the Liberals suddenly found themselves without\r\nfunds. In 1932 Carías grabbed power over little opposition, and\r\nhand-in-hand with United Fruit ruled his country for the next seventeen\r\nyears.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAn ominous reaction to such displays of U.S. force soon appeared. At\r\nthe Havana Conference of 1928 the Latin American nations resolved\r\nthat "No state has a right to intervene in the internal affairs of another."\r\nThe U.S. delegates fought the resolution, but when they offered a weak\r\nsubstitute, only four of the twenty American states (including, of course,\r\nNicaragua) voted with them. The original, damning resolution was put\r\noff until the next inter-American meeting, but Laurence Duggan, a top\r\nState Department expert on Latin America, later wrote: "<i>It was one of\r\nthe worst diplomatic defeats ever suffered by the United States at an\r\nimportant international conference.</i>"	1924	1925	4	48	Inevitable Revolutions: The United States in Central America  By Walter LaFeber	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.255364	2015-02-13 04:07:54.255364	\N
577	The Beginning of the  Immigration and Naturalization Service	<p class="entry columns">\r\n<font style="color:#cc0000;font-weight:bolder;">\r\nJune 10, 1933: U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt creates INS\r\n(Immigration and Naturalization Service)</font>\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAs immigration regulations become more complex, Roosevelt combines the\r\nimmigration and naturalization bureaus, creating the Immigration and\r\nNaturalization Service (INS). Over 365,000 people have been exiled from the\r\nUnited States since the start of the Great Depression, putting a strain on\r\nMexico's resources. The Mexican government establishes colonies in the\r\ntropical jungle region of southern Mexico, but they soon collapse after\r\ndozens die from hunger and disease in the first few weeks. The repatriation\r\ncampaign becomes harder to implement as Mexico begins to discourage\r\nrepatriation and even threatens to expel U.S. businesses from the country.\r\nMassive raids end and deportation trains decline, yet the INS remains\r\ncommitted to a policy of expulsion throughout the decade. At least 90,000\r\nmore people are sent to Mexico over the next four years. INS increases\r\nborder security and refuses re-admission to Mexicans who were repatriated.\r\nImmigration goes from 236,000 in 1929 to 23,000 in 1933.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/1933insstrike.jpg" class="floatright" style="width: 100%; padding-bottom: 9px;">\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe INS becomes involved in suppressing labor organizing throughout\r\nCalifornia. Crop prices improve in 1933 and farmers' gross income\r\nincreases, but their workers' wages hit their lowest point. Forty-eight\r\nthousand farm workers protest by waging the largest number of strikes in\r\nthe history of California agriculture. Farm bosses call for the expulsion\r\nof Mexicans from the country. Strike leaders are arrested and deported. INS\r\nagents poses as workers and persuades people to return to Mexico. Growers,\r\npolice, and INS used violence and deportation threats as strike-breaking\r\ntactics, collaborating with welfare agencies who withdraw assistance to\r\nforce strikers to accept unfair terms. The San Joaquin cotton strike alone\r\ninvolves ten to twelve thousand farm workers, over half of whom are Mexican\r\nAmericans and Mexican immigrants. 13 workers are shot and 3 killed (one of\r\nthem clubbed to death) by growers, who are acquitted of all charges.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nUp to 2 million Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants are exiled from\r\nthe U.S. during the repatriation campaign. It does not end until 1942 when\r\nthe government begins recruiting Mexicans to provide labor during WWII.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="caption"><i>Pictured,</i> Mexican workers protest farm bosses' use of violence to\r\nbreak the 1933 cotton strike.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<President Herbert Hoover merges the Bureau of Immigration and the Bureau of Naturalization to form the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).>	1933	1933	1	74	Mexican Workers and American Dreams by Camille Guerin-Gonzales,<br> Becoming Mexican-American by George Sanchez,<br> And Francisco Balderrama's Decade of Betrayal.	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.262717	2015-02-13 04:07:54.262717	\N

The succession of corrupt military dictators ruled Guatemala for over 30 years, one anti-communist tyrant after another receiving U.S. support, aid, and training.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAfter the 1982 coup that brought Ríos Montt to power, U.S. Ambassador Frederic C. Chapin said Guatemala &quot;has come out of the darkness and into the light.&quot; President Reagan claimed Mont was given &quot;a bum rap&quot; by human rights groups, and that he was cleaning up problems inherited from his predecessor, General Romeo Lucas Garcia. Ironically, Garcia had given $500,000 to Reagan's 1980 campaign, and his henchman, Mario Sandoval Alarcon, the &quot;Godfather&quot; of Central American death squads, was a guest at Reagan's first inaugural celebration. Sandoval proudly calls his National Liberation Movement &quot;the party of organized violence.&quot;\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nRíos Montt simply moved Garcia's dirty war from urban centers to the countryside &quot;where the spirit of the Lord&quot; guided him against &quot;communist subversives,&quot; mostly indigenous Indians.

Before this, passengers and mail either went around Cape Horn of South America or through a competing sea and overland route through Panama, well before the canal had been built.

45	The Dutch Capture of Recife	<div class="page" data-title="West Indian Company"></div>\r\n<p class="entry" style="position:relative;left:760px;width:365px;top:-9px;">\r\n&emsp;With the founding of the Dutch West India Company (WIC) in 1621, there is the emergence of a new type of aggressive and plundering bourgeoisie. Partly modeled on the VOC, or East India Trading Company, which had taken over much of Portugal's spice trade and seized a number of its fortified islands. In contrast to Eastern traders, the well-armed Dutch vessels generally refused to pay dues or tribute to local rulers; where necessary, the destroyed competitive suppliers and established their own. Their ships also took on, where needed, the pirates who ravaged the trade of the Indian Ocean and China seas. On the other hand, the Dutch VOC did not allow military expenses to outweigh the profits of trade, as was happening with the Portuguese in Asia by the close of the sixteenth century.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nLike the trading empire of the Portuguese king, the Dutch companies were integrated, nonspecialized enterprises, but with one remarkable difference. By producing their own protection, the companies not only expropriated the tribute but also became able to determine the quality and costs of protection themselves. This meant that protection costs were brought within range of rational calculation instead of being in the unpredictable region of 'the acts of God or the king's enemies.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn 1623-24, the VOC dispatched an expedition of eleven ships and 1,650 men to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, while the WIC sent a reconnoitering squadron to the Caribbean and a larger force, compromising twenty-three ships, to capture Bahia, Brazil's capital. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Recife"></div>\r\n<p class="entry" style="position:relative;left:760px;width:365px;top:-9px;">\r\nThe Portuguese forces and Brazilian militia mounted a stiff resistance but could not being prevent the city being seized, together with 70,000 <i>arrobas</i> of sugar awaiting shipment.\r\nWhen news of the capture reached the Peninsula a large force was immediately assembled for the relief of Bahia, the so-called 'expedition of the vassals'. This was commanded by a Spanish admiral, but was of overwhelmingly Portuguese composition. Numbering no fewer than 52 ships and 12,000 men, it captured Bahia after a Dutch occupation of less than a year.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe next major WIC coup was the capture of the Spanish silver fleet off the coast of Cuba in 1628 by a Dutch fleet of thirty ships; this was to be the only occasion on which the <i>flota</i> was lost to enemy action (this caused major havoc for the Spanish power).\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe Spanish silver allows the WIC to resuscitate its plans to seize Brazil, demonstrating by doing so why its special privileges and powers were justified. IT assembled an expedition for a renewed assault on Brazil in 1629-30, compromising 67 ships and 7,000 men. This succeeded in capturing the twin cities of Recife and Olinda, respectfully the major port and the capital of the colony's most important sugar-producing captaincy, Pernambuco. While a Spanish naval force failed to dislodge the WIC, the Dutch did not pacify the interior of Pernambuco until 1636 and hostilities hampered sugar output for years to come.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	1621	1630	1	18	The Making of New World Slavery by Robin Blackburn	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.296239	2015-02-13 04:07:54.296239	\N

605	Cotton becomes the primary export of Nicaragua	<div style="padding:9px 15px;position:relative;top:0px;left:-10px;background-color: rgba(255,255,255,.6);width:800px;"><p class="entry columns" style="padding:0;margin:0;opacity:1;">\r\n&emsp;Traditionally an area of cattle, grain, and sugar production, the departments\r\nof León and its northern neighbor Chinandega were transformed by\r\nan explosion of cotton production in the decade after World War II. By 1955\r\nthe fiber had replaced coffee as Nicaragua’s leading export. Cotton acreage\r\nincreased more than five times between 1951 and 1955, and production\r\nincreased almost ten times. Once the breadbasket of Nicaragua, the area\r\naround León was transformed into a dust bowl as plantation owners cut\r\ndown forests and expelled tenant farmers and Indian communities from\r\ntheir land. During the spring dry season, hot winds blew dust into every\r\ncorner of the city, and the air in León stank of pesticide.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;The rate of growth in agriculture alone during the 1950s and 1960s averaged nearly 5 percent a year,\r\none of the highest in the world. The explosion of cotton production starting\r\nin 1950 was joined in the next decade by a sharp increase in the export of beef,\r\na traditional Nicaraguan product, and the beginning of large-scale commercial\r\nproduction of sugar, seafood, tobacco, and bananas for export. The new\r\nCentral American Common Market led to a modest amount of industrialization,\r\nespecially in first-stage processing of agricultural products and the\r\npackaging of insecticide and fertilizer. Alliance for Progress–sponsored programs\r\ncreated some public sector jobs in the civil service and education, and\r\nagricultural and industrial expansion led to a growth in managerial and\r\ncommercial employment. U.S. economic aid in 1968 was twenty-seven times\r\nwhat it had been in 1960. A construction boom in the capital produced new\r\nmiddle-class neighborhoods. Downtown Managua acquired a real commercial\r\ndistrict, with shops stocking U.S.-made goods for newly affluent consumers.\r\nThe Nicaraguan middle class, still small even by Latin American\r\nstandards, was culturally very much oriented to the United States.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Most of the Nicaraguan population did not benefit from the economic\r\nboom. In the countryside, the distribution of wealth was more unequal than\r\never. In 1963, the top 0.1 percent of the rural population owned 20 percent of\r\nthe land, and the bottom half made do with about 3 percent. Cotton was not\r\na crop for small producers, and by the mid-1960s, 90 percent of cotton\r\nacreage was in the hands of large landowners. The growth of cotton production\r\nin the 1950s and 1960s was responsible for a greater degree of proletarianization\r\nof the peasantry than any previous crop. With the expansions\r\nof coffee production and cattle ranching in the nineteenth and early twentieth\r\ncenturies, small landowners had tended to be pushed into tenant arrangements\r\nor displaced onto the agricultural frontier. It was not until the\r\nadvent of cotton, the most profitable and highly mechanized crop in Nicaraguan\r\nhistory, that large numbers of peasants lost access to land altogether\r\nand, in many cases, migrated to the cities. Thousands poured into the barrios\r\norientales on the east side of Managua, sprawling communities of new urbanites,\r\nmany of whom traveled back to the cotton zone each year to work\r\nduring the harvest season. The population of the capital doubled during the\r\n1950s, to about 230,000, and then nearly doubled again in the course of the\r\n1960s. Although the middle class was concentrated in the capital, the majority\r\nof the city’s population was poor; in 1969 three-quarters of Managua\r\nhouseholds got by on less than $100 a month. By the end of the 1960s, nearly\r\nhalf the population of Nicaragua lived in urban areas, with Managua dwarfing\r\nall other cities and towns.</p></div>	1955	1955	5	57	SANDINISTA: Carlos Fonseca and the Nicaraguan Revolution by MATILDE ZIMMERMANN	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.321647	2015-02-13 04:07:54.321647	\N
49	Revolt against the Dutch 	<p class="entry columns3">\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nWith the departure of the capable governor Prince Maurits, there was a rapid deterioration in the\r\nDutch position. In June 1645 the moradores of Pernambuco rose in revolt\r\nagainst the increasingly intolerant and grasping policy of the Company.\r\nThis was led by Fernandes Vieira, who formed a terço that came to number\r\n1,800 men. The owner of a large estate in colonial Brazil would have his\r\nown armed henchmen [<i>agregados</i>] as well as <i>lavradores</i> dependent on him.\r\nDutch attempts to foreclose on loans and to prevent Catholic worship in\r\npublic in the capital alienated the <i>moradores</i>. The revolt acquired a\r\ndistinctly Brazilian character, but no doubt it was also strengthened by the\r\nstronger claims on Portuguese loyalty that could be exercised by the\r\nrestored monarchy in Lisbon. The Portuguese authorities did not publicly\r\nwelcome the revolt, but after some hesitation they did extend clandestine\r\nsupport to the rebels, conferring commissions on the leaders and sending\r\n150 experienced soldiers.\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nFrom the outset the rebellion was strengthened by the adhesion of Indian\r\nand black commanders who had never reconciled themselves to the Dutch.\r\nThe Portuguese had been in Brazil for well over a century, and the colonial\r\nsocial formation incorporated several thousands of Indians and free blacks,\r\nmost of them Catholics, the former organized under their own chiefs and\r\nthe latter with their own brotherhoods. In 1646 the black captain Henrique\r\nDias, <i>pictured</i>, led a column of 330 blacks, while the Indian Felipe Camarao led 460\r\nIndian fighters; together they comprised nearly a quarter of the Portuguese\r\nforces at this time, and proved militarily very effective. The Portuguese\r\nauthorities were aware of the value of support from Indians and blacks,\r\nand made some ideological concessions to encourage it. The Jesuit priest\r\n<a data-entry="870" data-year="1653" class="inline">Antonio Vieira</a>, already well-known in Portugal and Brazil for the brilliant\r\noratory of his sermons, vigorously castigated the Portuguese colonists for\r\nthe harsh way they treated Indians and blacks.\r\n<img src="/mapimages/henriquediasbrazil.png" class="floatright">\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe participation of Indians and blacks in the 'liberation' struggle was\r\nsubsequently to be the subject of much mythopoeic celebration by colonial\r\nand Imperial ideologists; an Henrique Dias regiment formed part of the\r\nBrazilian armed forces for over two hundred years. But both the Portuguese\r\nand the Dutch were most careful not to attack the institution of slavery.\r\nSome individual slaves were offered manumission if they would become\r\nsoldiers, but the mass of slaves were kept hard at work. As the revolt\r\nunfolded it sometimes afforded slaves the opportunity to escape; <i>quilombos</i>\r\nof slaves who had freed themselves in this way formed in the interior, such\r\nas the famous black republic of <a data-entry="36" data-year="1646" class="inline">Palmares</a>. But these fissures in the slave\r\nsystem were no plan of the plan of either side in the conflict.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe rebels repulsed Dutch columns sent against them, and greatly\r\ndisrupted the sugar economy. By 1646 the Company sent back only 55,800\r\narrobas of sugar, while the private traders did even worse, with cargoes of\r\njust under 20,000 arrobas, representing a total harvest of less than a quarter\r\nof the yields achieved in the early 1640s. Since the WIC used profits on\r\nsugar sales to finance its operations, this was a heavy blow.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="columns" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n"One of the remarkable things witnessed in the world today, and which we, because of our daily habits, do not see as strange, \r\nis the immense transmigration of Ethiopian peoples and nations who are constantly crossing over from Africa to this America \r\n… we can say that the ships which one after the other are entering our ports are carrying Africa to Brazil….\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThere is not a slave in Brazil—and especially when I gaze upon the most miserable among them—who for me is not an \r\nobject of profound meditation. When I compare the present with the future, time with eternity, that which I see with that \r\nwhich I believe, I cannot accept the idea that God, who created these people as much in His own image as He did the rest of \r\nus, would have predestined them for two hells, one in this life and another in the next. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nYou are the brothers of God’s preparation and the children of God’s fire.

582	Estado Novo	<div style="padding:9px 15px;position:relative;top:0px;left:-10px;background-color: rgba(255,255,255,.5);width:1000px;">\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="padding:0;margin:0;opacity:1;">\r\n\r\nBrazil&rsquo;s Vargas establishes authoritarian State, the Estado Novo. \r\n\r\nCivil unrest was a leitmotiv in these tumultuous years following the armed phase of the Revolution of 1930. In 1932, a civil war broke out in São Paulo, provoked by regional demands that the Vargas regime meet its commitment to reinstate constitutional law. Defeated on the battlefield, the paulistas still managed to pressure Vargas into accepting the formation of a Constituent Assembly. The assembly completed its work in early 1934, and the return to constitutional rule followed soon after. Legalists were saddened to see that ratification of the new constitution and the return to popular elections would not guarantee social or political peace. In November 1935, leftist soldiers quartered in the Northeast and Rio mutinied in hopes of inciting a popular uprising against the landholding elite. The central government responded to the so-called Intentona Comunista with ferocity, quickly putting down the rebellion. The state of siege and anti-leftist purges that followed the failed uprising circumscribed all democratic institutions. The presidential elections slated for 1938 neared under the specter of state violence. In early November 1937,Vargas’s military advisors fabricated evidence of another communist insurgency as a pretext for suspending the presidential elections and instituting an authoritarian-nationalist regime. According to Vargas, the Estado Novo (New State) announced on November 10 was supposed to restore to the Brazilian people an organic political culture that had been corrupted by liberalism during the First Republic and threatened by communism in the constitutional period. This Estado Novo was built on the state’s real and implied use of violence against any and all threats to the nation.\r\nMetaphors and monuments of war were ubiquitous under the Estado Novo. In the interior, federal troops, technicians, and settlers were sent on a ‘‘march’’ to conquer theWest. In the capital, the federal government erected monuments to the military heroism of nineteenth-century warriors Admiral Joaquim Marques Tamandaré (1807-97) and Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca, as well as government troops martyred at the Retreat at Laguna (1867) and the Intentona Comunista (1935).5 The state coordinated a Campanha da Borracha (Rubber Campaign) to help stimulate rubber production. In conjunction with the Rockefeller Foundation, the federal government organized an army of sanitation workers and public information campaigns in an attack on tropical and venereal diseases. Civil engineers and public health officials looked to the Baixada Fluminense, a particularly unhealthy region located to the north of the federal capital, as a battleground against miseryand underdevelopment. In the interior of theNortheast, bounty hunters pursued a guerrilla war against cangaceiros (outlaws) in hopes of stamping out the scourges of rural banditry and bossism. In 1939, the most notorious of the rural bandits, Lampião (Virgolino Ferreira da Silva),was captured and decapitated.His head,which remained on public display in Salvador da Bahia for three decades, was yet another prize in the regime’s war against internal disorder.\r\n<img src="/mapimages/estadonovovargas.jpg" class="floatleft" style="height:336px;width:500px;">\r\n\r\nOn the morning of November 29, 1937, Vargas presided over the symbolic attack upon the political culture of federalism, watching as the flags of all Brazilian states were ritually burned in a pyre mounted along Rio’s Russell Beach. The infamous Queima das Bandeiras (Burning of the Flags) was not merely a celebration of national unity, but rather an assault upon regional autonomy, individual rights, and political liberties.When Vargas’s civilian, military, and ecclesiastical allies watched the symbols of regional sovereignty go up in flames, they lent their support to the state’s attack upon elements of Brazilian society deemed threatening. Unbending regional elites, communists, liberal republicans, Jews, and unacculturated immigrants would bear the brunt of a broader assault on groups that did not conform to the regime’s vision of Brazilian society. The Estado Novo anticipated a militarized technology of internal surveillance, policing, repression, and countersubversion that took on horrid proportions during the military regime of 1964-85.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNationalism was perhaps, in this period, the identifiable common denominator of the military's political orientations in the several Latin American countries. The officers' seemingly ambiguous behaviour, often more authoritarian than reformist even in the 'revolutionary' experiments, always had its roots in their underlying concern, even in the pursuit of social justice, to reinforce the human, economic and therefore military potential of their nations. This orientation accorded with the policies of independent, inward-looking development through import substitution industrialization, which were beginning to be adopted at the time. This national-militarist current, which was not systematically opposed to change if carried out in an orderly fashion, nor to improvements in the labouring classes' conditions if accomplished under the state's tutelage, seems to have been dominant in the armed forces. \r\n<br>\r\nBrazil's trade union structure dates from the Estado Novo. Vargas' model was Mussolini's labor code, which states that trade\r\nunions are subordinate to the Ministry of Labor. Union membership is obligatory. The Ministry controls the finances, collecting members' dues and apportioning funds within the trade union structure. It can intervene in union affairs, removing officers and appointing its own nominees in certain cases.<br>\r\nWithout multiplying the examples, suffice it to recall that in Brazil, not only did numerous officers show an affinity for <i>integralismo</i>, but the Estado Novo itself was founded in 1937 by a general staff imbued with similar attitudes. General Pedro Goes Monteiro, minister of war (1934—37) and army chief of staff (1937—44), who hoped &quot;progressively to increase state power&quot; and who was a fascist sympathizer and pro-German, listed among the great men of the day, who embodied the political experiments he admired:&quot;Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin, Mustafa Kemal Pacha, Roosevelt and Salazar&quot;. <br> They had, in his view, each in his own way, succeeded in 'creating new organs and new state institutions, thereby furnishing the state with the means to overcome the domestic crisis'. The political ideal of the Estado Novo's most important military potentate was, in brief, that &quot;the state must have the power to intervene to regulate the whole of collective life and to discipline the nation.&quot; \r\n<br>Repression of the left was intensified after the failed Communist-military risings of November 1935, and the Integralists were forcefully suppressed after the failure of their May 1938 coup attempt. The Italian and German communities of southern Brazil naturally contained many Axis sympathizers, and were also Integralist strongholds. The Estado Novo imposed censorship and relied on a powerful secret police apparatus. Immigrant enclaves with their own schools, newspapers and autonomous civic organizations were now brought under central control and required to promote the Portuguese language. The German community, in particular, was forced in 1938 to choose between its allegiance to the Reich and its allegiance to Brazil, and thousands left for Europe in disgust. An August 1938 decree provided that conscripts must only speak Portuguese during their military training. \r\nIt is decided officially in 1942 to deny military school access to non-Catholics (especially Jews) and blacks, and also to the children of immigrants, political opponents, and divorcees or concubines.\r\nThe large Japanese community in Brazil was also subject to these measures, although in practice it preserved a large degree of separateness, at least until the shock of the Emperor's surrender in 1945. For several years thereafter a substantial sector of the Japanese community persisted in believing this to be a lie, propaganda invented by the Brazilian and western press.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</div>	1937	1937	1	15	The Cambridge History of Latin America, Volume 6	large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:54.393533	2015-02-13 04:07:54.393533	\N
344	Capture and Murder of Che Guevara	<p class="entry columns" style="background-color:white;padding:9px;position:relative;top:329px;">\r\n&emsp;On October 9, 1967, in the small rural village of La Higuera, Bolivia, at\r\napproximately 1:15 in the afternoon, a Bolivian army sergeant, Mario Teran,\r\nafter fortifying himself with alcohol, walked into the mud-walled schoolhouse\r\nwhere Che, already wounded, was being held prisoner, and shot him dead. It was\r\nmurder. Under the laws that govern warfare, including guerilla war, the killing of\r\na prisoner is murder and constitutes a war crime. It is not just the actual shooter\r\nwho is guilty of a war crime. Those higher-ups that ordered, acquiesced to, or\r\nfailed to prevent the murder are guilty as well. There is no statute of limitations\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nChe Guevera had captured by CIA and U.S.-trained Bolivian Rangers on October 8. There are two CIA agents, Gustovo Villoldo and Felix Rodriguez, working with the Bolivian military; Rodriguez is there when Che is executed.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOn the morning of the ninth, Rodríguez sets up his radio and transmits a coded message to the CIA station in either Peru or Brazil to be retransmitted to Langley headquarters. Rodríguez also starts to photograph Che's diary and other captured documents. Later, Rodríguez spends time talking with Che and takes a picture with him. The photos that Rodríguez takes are preserved by the CIA. \r\n According to Rodriguez, Che's final words are <span style="color:#cc0000;font-weight:bold;">"Tell my wife to remarry and tell Fidel Castro that the Revolution will again rise in the Americas."</span> To his frightened and hesitant executionar he said, "Remember, you are killing a man."\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn a memorandum written for President Lyndon Johnson, Special Assistant for National Security Affairs, Walt Rostow writes:<br>&emsp;<i>\r\n"It marks the passing of another of the aggressive, romantic revolutionaries like Sukarno, Nkrumah, Ben Bella&#8212;and reinforces this trend.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn the Latin American context, it will have a strong impact in discouraging would-be guerrillas. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIt shows the soundness of our ‘preventive medicine' assistance to countries facing incipient insurgency&#8212;it was the Bolivian 2nd Ranger Battalion, trained by our Green Berets from June-September of this year, that cornered him and got him.\r\n<br>&emsp;We have put these points across to several newsmen."</i>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<span class="caption">The last picture of Che alive is with CIA Agent Felix Rodriguez, <i>left</i>.</span>\r\n	1967	1967	10	13	Who Killed Che? by Michael Ratner and Michael Steven Smith	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.405154	2015-02-13 04:07:54.405154	\N

73	El Cobre	<p class="entry columns" style="width:800px;"><font class="intro">Enslaved Afro-Cubans forced by the Spanish administration to work the copper mines of Santiago del Prado, also known as El Cobre, on the island of Cuba, flee into the mountains.</font>\r\n\r\nIn the early 1500s, the Spanish settled near the copper mines of Santiago\r\ndel Prado, also known as El Cobre, on the island of Cuba. In the 1530s,\r\nthey introduced African slaves to work in the mines, but the Spanish later\r\nabandoned the mines for many years. During this time, the former African\r\nslaves established their own communities in the area. It is also important to\r\nnote that El Cobre became the site of a shrine to Our Lady of Charity of El\r\nCobre dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The Virgin would become an important\r\nunifying symbol for the slaves as they struggled for their freedom.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn 1731, the Spanish attempted to enslave the Afro-Cuban descendants of\r\nthe slaves who had once worked the mines. Since the Spanish crown\r\nowned and operated the mines, these men and women became royal slaves.\r\nUpset at abuses of their rights by the government, they demanded greater\r\nautonomy and refused to march in a military parade. The Afro-Cubans were\r\nencouraged by their belief in the Virgin, whom they believed protected\r\nthem and gave them the right to the land upon which they lived. In\r\nresponse, they fled into the nearby mountains. To demonstrate the importance\r\nof the Virgin, the slaves tried unsuccessfully to remove the statue of\r\nthe Virgin from the shrine.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nPedro Ignacio Ximenez, the governor of Cuba, condemned the runaways\r\nfor their actions. When he discovered the leaders of the plot, he had thirty-six\r\nof them exiled. However, two years later in 1733, the King of Spain\r\ndefended his royal slaves, ordering that they be treated without oppression\r\nand showing that they enjoyed certain entitlements as slaves of the crown.\r\nNevertheless, tension between the slaves and the local government\r\ncontinued.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn 1780, the Spanish government privatized the mines, leading to a loss\r\nof privileges for the slaves. In 1783, the slaves prepared a document in\r\nwhich they protested the loss of their privileged status as royal slaves. They\r\ncited the power of the Virgin to protect them. This tactic seemed to work,\r\nas the daughter of the Cuban governor fell ill and was cured with the aid of\r\nthe Virgin. To show his gratitude, the governor did not immediately hand\r\nthe slaves over to their new, private owners.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nBetween 1780 and 1800, the slaves struggled to gain their freedom\r\nthrough flight, violence, and litigation. Finally, in April 1800, the Spanish\r\ncrown granted their freedom in a royal edict that was read at the steps of\r\nthe shrine of the Virgin. Although the former slaves still had certain labor obligations, it was still seen as a remarkable achievement.\r\n</p>	1731	1731	7	32	Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion, Volume 1  edited by Junius P.

873	Francisco Cuadrado Prats and the Death of Pinochet	<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:.9em;">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/pinochetcoffin.jpg" class="floatleft">\r\n&emsp;"When General Augusto Pinochet breathed his last on Dec. 10, this much seemed clear to everybody in Chile: The man who had lived his whole life and never paid for even one of his crimes had done it again. Once more—one final time—everybody in Chile thought that Pinochet had escaped judgment. Everybody, that is, except for a young man named Francisco Cuadrado Prats, who decided that some sort of punishment, no matter how symbolic, was merited. So he walked up to Pinochet's coffin and deliberately, calmly spat on the dictator's face as he lay there in full regalia.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;The grandfather of the young man, Gen. Carlos Prats, was commander in chief of the Chilean army. Feeling he could no longer stop the impending military coup against President Salvador Allende, Prats resigned his post and recommended that his replacement be the most loyal of his generals, a man he had befriended and protected his whole life—Augusto Pinochet.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;I was working at the presidential palace and can remember how glad, almost giddy, we were when Allende followed Prats' advice. At a farewell gathering honoring Prats, the name Pinochet was on all our lips. He was someone we could trust, someone who would save democracy and avoid the violence descending upon us. Among those present at the party were Allende's last two ministers of defense, Jose Toha and Orlando Letelier. They relied on their "friend" Augusto, "good old Pinochet," to rescue the republic from disaster.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;One week later, Sept. 11, 1973, Allende was dead, Toha and Letelier were prisoners of a military junta and Prats had been banished to Argentina. Pinochet had betrayed his president, his friends and his country.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;But that was not enough. The new ruler had to be rid of the men who had believed in him, who had seen him obsequiously swearing allegiance to the president, who had witnessed his duplicity. Toha was murdered in a Chilean dungeon a few months after the coup. Letelier was assassinated in Washington in 1976. As to Carlos Prats, he and his wife were blown up on a Buenos Aires street on Sept. 30, 1974, by agents of Pinochet's secret police.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;But not all was despair. The grandson would also watch and participate in the Chileans' movement to defeat the dictator and recover their lost democracy. By 1990, Pinochet no longer ruled the country. But for the next eight years, he thwarted the emergence of a full democracy by using various authoritarian features of the system and his role as commander in chief of the army. He threatened rebellion at whim, publicly warning Chile's elected leaders, for instance, that if they dared touch, let alone prosecute, one of the men under his command, he would rise up again. There appeared to be virtually no chance that justice would be done.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Then, almost miraculously, Pinochet was arrested in London in 1998 after Spanish authorities charged him with murder, torture, illegal detention and disappearances. He escaped extradition to Spain by feigning dementia, but upon his return to Chile, he found that the country had changed. Some of the fear he had inspired was gone. The judiciary and politicians, shamed before the world by the charges issued in Spain, were ready to indict him for all manner of human rights violations. Among the cases was the murder of Carlos Prats and his wife, Sophia.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;But Pinochet's lawyers, often with the connivance of sluggish judges and a wary political class, successfully delayed the numerous proceedings against the dictator, and he never was convicted of anything. (Chilean judges denied on a technicality an Argentine magistrate's demand that the general be extradited for trial in Prats' murder.)\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Then, just when death seemed to protect Pinochet from punishment, insult was added to injury when the former dictator was rewarded with funeral rites he didn't deserve. Although President Michelle Bachelet (herself a torture victim whose father died of maltreatment in Pinochet's prisons) refused to give the dead dictator a state funeral, she could not stop the army from burying him with full honors.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;It was too much for Prats' grandson.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Let me confess that spitting on a dead man—even if he is responsible for the deaths of so many of my friends, the devastation of my life and the agony of my country—makes me feel queasy and uncomfortable. There is something sacred about the dead, about their sad vulnerability, about the rules and protocols that we need to honor when a life, no matter how miserable, has ended.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Yet, who can blame Francisco Cuadrado Prats? His was the tiniest of revolts, barely two or three seconds long (after which he was beaten and kicked by rabid Pinochet supporters before being rescued by a group of military policemen), but it spoke for his murdered grandparents and for all the mutilated and missing bodies of his land. It expressed what millions of Chileans had long dreamed of doing and what only one of us finally dared to do."\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	2006	2006	7	25	Excerpted from Spitting on the dead dictator By ARIEL DORFMAN	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.447108	2015-02-13 04:07:54.447108	\N
23	"Totally Exterminated in the Gold Mines"	<p class="entry ">The Caribbean island populations finally stopped paying tribute because they had disappeared: they were totally exterminated in the gold mines, in the deadly task of sifting auriferous sands with their bodies half submerged in water, or in breaking up the ground beyond the point of exhaustion, doubled up over the heavy cultivating tools brought from Spain. Many natives of Haiti anticipated the fate imposed by their white oppressors: they killed their children and committed mass suicide. The mid-sixteenth-century historian Fernández de Oviedo interpreted the Antillean holocaust thus: &quot;Many of them, by way of diversion, took poison rather than work, and others hanged themselves with their own hands.&quot;\r\n<img src="/mapimages/gold-small.jpg" style="position:relative;top:-620px;left:-20px;">\r\n</p>	1540	1560	1	2	Open Veins of Latin America	medium	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.458245	2015-02-13 04:07:54.458245	\N
195	The Walker Lessons	<p class="entry columns">\r\n&emsp;In 1856, US adventurer William Walker (1824-60) and a gang of fifty-eight\r\nmercenaries, tied to Vanderbilt's rivals, arrived in Nicaragua to help the\r\nlocal Liberal Party in its political dispute with the Conservatives. What\r\nhappened was one of the most bizarre events in American history.\r\nWalker led a coup d'etat and declared himself president of Nicaragua.\r\nVanderbilt, never one to run away from financing violence against his\r\nenemies, helped turn the tide against Walker, who resigned, fled and\r\nwas subsequently shot in Honduras (<i>pictured</i>) in the midst of mounting another\r\nplot to retake Nicaragua. This action took place during the course of\r\ntwo years.<br>\r\n&emsp;The fact that an American entrepreneur could induce the US government\r\nto act against a supposedly sovereign state, and that a US\r\nfilibusterer, as Walker was then known, could invade and take over a\r\ncountry, left an indelible impression on Nicaraguans—one that was\r\npassed on to future generations.\r\n<img src="/mapimages/executionofwilliamwalker.jpg" style="width:100%;column-span: all;COLSPAN=2;">\r\n</p>	1856	1856	1	57	THE GUERRILLA WARS OF CENTRAL AMERICA, Saul Landau 	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.468524	2015-02-13 04:07:54.468524	\N

But the Communist Party and main sectors of the Socialist Party told people to wind down the <i>cordones</i> and trust in the ‘constitutional’ traditions of the army. Allende brought generals, including Augusto Pinochet, into his government, believing this would placate the right and maintain order. <br>\r\nBut on September 11, the military strikes again.<br>\r\nDuring the fighting, the military demanded that President allende surrender, and made a perfunctory offer to fly him and his family out of the country. In a now famous audiotape of General Pinochet issuing instructions to his troops via radio communications on September 11, he is heard to laugh and swear &quot;that plane will never land.&quot; Forecasting the savagery of his regime, Pincohet added: <strong>&quot;Kill the bitch and you eliminate the litter.&quot;</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nAt around nine o'clock Allende stepped onto the balcony for a final, forlorn look over Constitution Square. Half an hour later, through a makeshift radio hookup, he addressed his last words to his people.\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Allende delivered his impassioned farewell, infantry units began advancing on the palace under cover of artillery fire. Defenders\r\nfired back, and men on both sides fell. Shortly before noon, two British-made Hawker Hunter fighters roared out of the sky. They swooped down and fired at the palace, striking so accurately that one missile flew right through the palace's main door. Eighteen rockets hit the old building, which burst into flames. Inside, the air filled with smoke and fumes.\r\n<br>\r\n Salvador Allende was found dead from gunshot wounds in his inner office around 2:00 p.m. At 2:300 p.m., the armed forces radio network broadcast an announcement that La Moneda had &quot;surrendered&quot; and that the entire country was under military control.\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Pinochet's first acts after the coup was to order a nationwide series of raids on leftists and other supporters of the deposed regime, known as "the Caravan of Death". The harshness with which this campaign was conducted, the tens of thousands of people\r\n who were arrested, the conditions under which they were held, \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n<td  width="60%"  valign="top">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/allendeslaststand-bg.jpg" style="position:relative;right:0px;top:-12px;">\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns" style=" font-size:.9em;">\r\n\r\nand the fact that many were never seen again set the tone for what would be years of repression. The regime ordered summary executions for scores of leftist leaders. Many more died at the hands of soldiers and rightist thugs\r\nwho swept through pro-Allende slums, called <i>poblaciones</i>, beating and killing as they rampaged.<br>\r\n  On October 8, Newsweek reported that city morgues in Santiago had received a total of 2,796 corpses since the coup, most with either crushed skulls or execution-style bullet wounds.<br>\r\nOfficials of the Allende government were rounded up and sent to a prison on desolate Dawson Island, in Chile's extreme south. The junta abolished the country's largest labor federation, which had 800,000 members; banned all political parties that had supported Allende; declared Congress in "indefinite recess "; summarily dismissed hundreds of university professors; removed all mayors and city councillors from office; and decreed a new legal code that forbade any appeal of decisions by military courts.

After 10 days, he and his wife were handed over to someone from US Embassy. The following morning they were flown back to the States. They have never been back to Chile.</i><br>\r\n\r\n"There were two lines. We called them the line of life and the line of death. One line led out, away from the stadium, the other led inside. The demeanour of people in the one line seemed relaxed. The people in the other line were heavily guarded. They seemed stunned, stolid-faced. They were taking people into the stadium about 20 at a time, several times a day. It was men and women. Mainly adults. Mainly working-class people. There were a lot of native Indians. We never saw those people again. \r\n<br>\r\nWe were totally unprepared. We did not know what to do. They basically just threw us down against a concrete wall where we were held for 10 days while they questioned us. If we wanted to go to the toilet they took us to a room containing about 75 people. We saw people being beaten up and taken off for torture. At one point they brought in two teenagers who had been fighting against the anti-government forces and they beat them up in front of us.\r\n<br>\r\nJust before they led the one line out into the stadium, they would start the extractor fans in the changing rooms just to make some noise. They did not want people to know what was happening. Then they would lead the line of people out of the changing rooms into the stadium. There was a concrete wall between where I was being held and the stadium but I could hear everything. On one occasion my wife heard the people in the stadium singing `the Internationale'. Then the machine-guns started. The gunfire would last for 45 seconds, maybe a minute, and then there was no sound.

Antofagasta was under siege and the atmosphere was terrifying. My father was called to report to the army and our home was raided and ransacked by the military. We were forced to leave the house with our mother.\r\n<br>\r\nGiven that my father had a position of trust in the government of President Salvador Allende, he was in Santiago attending work meetings during those days. Because of the seriousness of the situation, the Mexican Ambassador offered him political asylum. He did not accept it because his family was unprotected in Antofagasta. He was convinced that the Chilean Army is republican, loyal, and anti-coup. Under this belief he traveled back to Antofagasta where he found his family scattered between friends' houses.\r\n<br>\r\nOn 13 September 1973 he gave himself up to the army. When he said good bye to us, his children, he showed his hands saying that they were clean and that he had done nothing wrong. We never saw him again. Only through stories from other people we learned what was happening in the detention centres, learning that people were brutally tortured. As my father was a lawyer, the President of the local Lawyers’ Association came to the detention centre to visit him and to offer counsel, this was denied. This is recorded in the testimonies which are part of the legal proceedings underway in Chile.\r\n<br>\r\nOn 19 October 1973, a helicopter landed in our city. This was an army delegation under the command of General Sergio Arellano Stark, who was under personal orders from and invested by Augusto Pinochet with power to remove all political prisoners from the city and execute them. At dawn on that morning, 14 people were massacred without trial, without charges, totally illegal.\r\n<br>\r\nThey were massacred in such a way that according to the forensic doctor’s statement it was impossible to assemble the bodies, because of the impacts of machine gun fire. The family was not informed. At 9 am my mother goes to the prison to request information on the current situation and she was told “What are you looking for? They are all dead”. We begged for the bodies to be returned to us as they have lined them in the street outside the morgue. The army authority finally gave us the bodies on condition that we leave the city. We went to the city of Vallenar guarded by the army; we could not place his name on his grave.

Less than a year after the coup, his government announced an agreement with Anaconda Copper under which the company would receive $253 million in cash and promissory notes for its expropriated assets. Kennecott Copper received $66.9 million. Chile also settled with ITT, paying the company $125.2 million for its interest in the Chilean Telephone Company.\r\n<br>\r\nIn 1976, Henry Kissinger traveled to Santiago to deliver a speech to the Organization of American States. The day before his public appearance, he met privately with Pinochet to assure him that although his speech would include a few perfunctory references to human rights, it was "not aimed at Chile."\r\n<br>\r\n"My evaluation is that you are a victim of all left-wing groups around the world, and that your greatest sin was that you overthrew a government that was going communist," Kissinger told Pinochet. "We welcomed the overthrow of the communist-inclined government here.

They disembarked at Acla, and Gil Gonzalez went to Darien, to secure the support of the governor, for his enterprise. The ships, having been built in the Rio de la Balsa, were sent down to the sea, passed the island of Pearls, and, Panama having been peopled in 1519, the flotilla was brought there. This Gil Gonzalez had to discover a certain number of leagues to the westward, concerning which the capitulation had been made; and thus he coasted along and arrived at the gulf of San Lucar, which had already been discovered by Pedrarias. It is at the commencement of the land of Nicaragua. Having passed the place where Leon and Granada now stand, he disembarked, and came to a village where he found one hundred thousand <i>pesos de oro</i>? As soon as his arrival was known in the land, a large force of warlike Indians came against him, and obliged him to fall back and embark again, as he had not sufficient force to resist them. He returned to Panama with the gold, and went thence to Spain; but returned to San Domingo, and equipped an expedition to settle in Nicaragua, going by way of Honduras.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;At this time Pedrarias sent one Francisco Hernandez de Cordova in command of a force, to subdue and settle Nicaragua; and he entered that land, subduing and conquering, and fighting in many skirmishes and battles. He founded the cities of Leon and Granada, and built fortresses in them, for defense. This land was very populous and fertile, yielding supplies of maize, and many fowls of the country, and certain small dogs which they also eat, and many deer and fish. It is a very salubrious land. The Indians were very civilized in their way of life, like those of Mexico, for they were a people who had come from that country, and they had nearly the same language (Five languages were spoken in Nicaragua. The <i>Charibizi</i>, the <i>Cholotecan</i> (being the most ancient), the <i>Choutal</i>, the <i>Orotinan</i>, and Mexican.). These people went about well dressed in the Indian fashion; the\r\nwomen with their mantles like those of Coiba, and another description of covering which, descending from the head, covered the bosom and half the arms. The men covered their loins with very long cloths made of cotton, which they passed in many folds from the hips to the thighs. In the villages they wore their mantles like cloaks under the arms. They had a great quantity of cotton cloth,\r\nand they held their markets in the open squares, where they traded. The land was poor in gold, and they traded with cacao, as in New Spain. \r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="...Sacrifice"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="height:455px;">\r\n<strong>1522</strong><i> Gil Gonzalez Davila explores Nicaragua, which he names after a cacique, Nicarao.</i>\r\n<br>\r\n"They had many beautiful women. Their parents had a custom, when they were maidens old enough to marry, of sending them to work for their marriages, and thus they went through the land working publicly, and as soon as they had wherewithal to furnish a house, they returned to their parents and were married. The husbands were so much under subjection that if they made their wives angry, they were turned out of doors, and the wives even raised their hands against them. The husband would go to the neighbors and beg them to ask his wife to let him come back, and not be angry with him. The wives made their husbands attend on them, and\r\ndo everything like servant lads. They had another custom, which was that when one of them was married, a man whom they held as a pope, and who lived in a temple, had to sleep with the bride on the previous night. In this temple there was a statue of gold, to which they sacrificed through the instrumentality of him who was there as priest, and their sacrifice was that, in the presence of the statue, they tore out the hearts of men and women who were sacrificed, and anointed the statue with them. They also cut out the tongues with certain stones like razors, and anointed the statue with them. Likewise they offered up much game and fish, and other eatables, and of these the priest, who resided there, did eat. The Indians made a sort of confession of certain sins which appeared to them to be heinous, and they thought that, by confessing them to this priest, they were freed from them.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;This is a land of abundance of good fruit, and of honey and wax, wherewith all the neighboring countries are supplied.\r\nThe bees are very numerous, some of them yellow, and these do not sting. They deposit the honey under the ground. There are many wolves in this land, which live upon the deer. They make wine from a kind of cherry, which is as strong as the wine of Spain, although the strength soon passes away. In all the countries I have mentioned the whole happiness of the people consists in drinking the wine they make from maize, which is like beer, and on this they get as drunk as if it was the wine of Spain, and all the festivals they hold, are for the purpose of drinking...\r\n<br>\r\n...This land is poor in gold. No mines have been found, except seventy leagues from Leon; and by taking the people from a warm and level country to dig out gold at such a distance and in high mountains, a very large part of the population has disappeared; and afterwards, there being no one to cultivate the land, the Spaniards began to make slaves, and to reward the chiefs who brought slaves to them. They were taken in great numbers to be sold at Panama and in Peru; and these are the reasons why this country is now so much depopulated."<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/gilgonzalezdavilaend2.gif">\r\n</p>	1522	1522	1	57	Narrative of the Proceedings of Pedrarias Davila in the Provinces of Tierra Firme, or Castilla del Oro (originally published 1865)	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.496596	2015-02-13 04:07:54.496596	\N
620	Brotherhood and Condeca	<div class="page" data-title="Condeca"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="height:500px">\r\n<strong>1962</strong> <i>\r\nU.S.-sponsored Operation Brotherhood, forerunner to CONDECA, stages military exercises with participation by Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. </i><br>\r\n<br> &emsp;As well as encouraging the economic integration of Central America, the United States was anxious to promote collaboration and cooperation between the armed forces of the region.\r\n<br> &emsp;The Guatemalan and Nicaraguan governments were the most enthusiastic about the idea. In 1962 two guerrilla movements had appeared in Guatemala, the 13 November Revolutionary Movement (MR 13 de Noviembre) and the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR). In Nicaragua the Sandinista National Liberation Forces (FSLN) was formally founded in 1961.\r\n<br> &emsp;In September 1962, in order to promote coordination, the United States sponsored a series of military exercises which were given the name 'Operation Brotherhood'. They involved armed units from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Colombia and the Canal Zone and they centered around a hypothetical guerrilla attack on Honduras national airport. In 1964, with strong United States backing, the defense ministers of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua signed an agreement establishing the Central American Defense Council (CONDECA). Costa Rica, whose army had been abolished in 1948, and Panama were given observer status with an option to join. \r\n<br> \r\n<img src="/mapimages/condeca.gif" style="max-width:100%;">\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;The Objectives of CONDECA were to coordinate action against internal subversion, and to facilitate United States control  over such action. The CIA and the Central American representatives of the United States armed forces acted as advisors to CONDECA. It was also seen as a convenient way of standardizing the training and equipping of the region's armies and reducing regional military rivalries. In addition, the United States tried to use the organization to promote the militarization of Costa Rica and in 1966 Costa Rica secretly took part in one of CONDECA joint maneuvers  known as  'Operation Nicarao.' \r\n<br> &emsp;Altogether some ten anti-guerrilla maneuvers were conducted under the auspice of CONDECA, the last one, 'Operation Aguila VI', took place in Nicaragua in 1976. In 1972 there were strong suggestions that the Nicaragua and Guatemalan air forces helped a right-wing government in El Salvador crush an attempted coup. \r\n<br> &emsp;However the organization never achieved the regional military coordination the United States had hoped for. Honduras withdrew after the war with El Salvador in 1969, and in 1979 the fall of Somoza, whose National Guard had been the backbone of the alliance, further contributed to its decline. By then the United States had in any case reached the conclusion than regional rivalries  and differences prevented the organization from becoming an effective instrument of coordinated counter-insurgency and had ceased to have a formal advisory role in is. Nevertheless, CONDECA has left a legacy of friendship and personal ties between the most right-wing army officers of the region and the idea of mutual assistance has not been abandoned.<br>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Postscript"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="height:500px">\r\n<strong>1962</strong> <i>\r\nU.S.-sponsored Operation Brotherhood, forerunner to CONDECA, stages military exercises with participation by Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. </i><br>\r\n<span style="font-size:90%">\r\nIn 1983, the Christian Scientist Monitor reported:<br>\r\n<i>\r\n&emsp;The Reagan administration is backing steps to reactivate the Central American Defense Council (CONDECA), a regional anticommunist military alliance that could play a role in Nicaragua similar to that of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States in Grenada. (President Reagan cited a request from OECS countries as one of the reasons for US intervention in Grenada.)\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Another signal of military activity was once-secret meeting of military chiefs of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama and the head of the US southern command, four-star Gen. Paul Gorman, on Oct. 1 to lay the groundwork for the revitalization of CONDECA. The chiefs issued a strongly worded declaration endorsing ''the use of force against Marxism . . . to defend democracy and stimulate development in the region.''\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Reactivation of CONDECA is itself interpreted by political observers here as a significant step toward the outbreak of hostilities. Describing CONDECA as something too important to leave to the military, El Tiempo, a leading newspaper here, editorialized: ''The reactivation of CONDECA at this moment, particularly a CONDECA that has endorsed 'the use of force against Marxism,' is tantamount to a declaration of war (against Nicaragua).''\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;In an interview Friday, US Ambassador to Honduras John Negroponte, pictured, maintained that Central American countries, in response to the Sandinistas' military manpower, have the right to take steps to defend themselves. This includes the reactivation of CONDECA, he said.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Mr. Negroponte, who is considered a key architect of Reagan administration policy in the area, said: ''Even though there's a negotiating process going on, until that negotiating process bears fruit the countries can't stop doing the other things they believe necessary to defend themselves. . . .\r\n<br><img src="/mapimages/NegroponteHonduras1984-small.jpg" class="floatright" style="">\r\n&emsp;Honduran Gen. Gustavo Alvarez Martinez has repeatedly described CONDECA as a ''contingency . . . if the Contadora process fails.'' Yet other diplomats and political figures in the region, among them Costa Rican President Luis Alberto Monge, seem to feel less than comfortable with this two-track strategy of preparing for war and peace. President Monge is reported to believe that CONDECA's reactivation would effectively derail the Contadora negotiations.\r\n</i>\r\n<br>\r\n(Nicaraguan rebels hope for US invasion, November 1, 1983, Christian Science Monitor)\r\n</span>\r\n</p>	1962	1962	1	99	Under the Eagle by Jenny Pearce	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.50521	2015-02-13 04:07:54.50521	\N

190	The Caudillo	<p class="entry columns">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/juanmanuelderosas.jpg" class="floatright">\r\nJuan Manuel de Rosas (1793-1877), who gained fame as a fighter of\r\nIndians and dominated Argentina from 1829 to 1852, exemplified caudillo rule.\r\n\r\nJuan Manuel\r\nde Rosas, a pioneer on the southern frontier, owner of vast estates, lord\r\nof numerous peons, a militia commander who could parley with the\r\nIndians and frighten the politicians, and governor of Buenos Aires from\r\n1829, stood for a policy of expansion and settlement and took a number\r\nof positive steps to improve the security of landholding. He organized\r\nand led the Desert Expedition of 1833 to the Rio Colorado and the Rio\r\nNegro, with the object of containing Indian aggression, expanding the\r\nfrontier and imposing an enduring peace. His policy included diplomacy\r\nas well as force, presents as well as punishment. And it succeeded, adding\r\nto the province of Buenos Aires thousands of square miles, not desert,\r\nbut land watered by great rivers. Rewards were instantaneous. The\r\nprovincial government transferred large tracts of the new land to private\r\nhands in the years following 1833, especially to the senior officers of the\r\nexpeditionary force itself. And as the settlers pushed southwards, they\r\nencroached once more on Indian hunting grounds. But now, in the\r\n1840s, they were viewed by the Indians with more respect, partly because\r\nof the military reputation of Rosas, partly because of the policy of\r\npacification by subsidy.\r\n\r\nlegal structure of landholding. There were three methods of land\r\nacquisition - rent, purchase and grant. Emphyteusis had now outlived its\r\nusefulness. It had facilitated land exploitation (and land concentration),\r\nbut the state had profited hardly at all, for the rent was minimal. Rosas\r\ntherefore decided to sell public land outright and to receive a specific\r\nrevenue when he needed it. Laws of land sale in 1836-8 placed vast tracts\r\nof land on the open market. Most of it obviously went to the wealthy, the\r\npowerful, the favoured; and the names of the large purchasers were\r\nalmost identical with those of the large tenants under emphyteusis, the\r\nAnchorena, Diaz Velez, Alzaga and Arana. By 1840 3,436 square leagues\r\n(20,616,000 acres) of the province were in the possession of 293 people.\r\nYet there was not a rush to buy land, and many would-be purchasers\r\nwere deterred, either by economic recession, as during the French\r\nblockade of 1838-40, or by political insecurity. As an alternative to\r\nselling land, therefore, Rosas gave it away. Generous land grants were\r\nmade to supporters of the regime, to the military who fought its wars or\r\ncrushed its rebels, to bureaucrats and to favourites. Land became almost\r\na currency and sometimes a wages and pensions fund. It was the ultimate\r\nsource of patronage and, when confiscated, a terrible punishment.\r\nBy the 1840s the great plains of Buenos Aires were divided into wellstocked\r\nestancias and supported some 3 million head of cattle, the prime\r\nwealth of the province and the source of an export economy. They were\r\nanimals of inferior grade, raised in the open range under the care of a few\r\nherdsmen; but they yielded hides and salt meat, and that was what the\r\nmarket demanded.\r\nThe estancia had to sell its products in Buenos Aires and beyond, but\r\nthe infrastructure of the province was even more primitive than the\r\nestates which it served. This was a country without roads or bridges, and\r\nwith tracks only on the main routes. Almost everything was done and\r\nsupplied from horseback, and horses were as important a product of the\r\nestancia as cattle. Horses carried gauchos across the plains and armies into\r\nbattle. Fishermen fished in the river on horseback; beggars even begged\r\non horseback. But the chief method of freight transport were bullock\r\ncarts, made in the workshops of Tucuman and led by hard-bitten drivers\r\noperating chiefly along the two high roads which traversed Argentina,\r\none from Buenos Aires through San Luis and Mendoza to Chile, the\r\nother from Buenos Aires via Cordoba, Santiago, Tucuman, Salta and\r\nJujuy to Bolivia. They travelled in trains of some fourteen carts, each\r\ndrawn by six oxen with three spare, moving slowly across pampas and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Rosas was a rancher of the great cattle frontier called the pampa, and frontier militias stiffened his grip on the city of Buenos Aires. He made routine use of violence against his political opponents, but also shrewd use of political imagery and mass propaganda. Rosas had his picture placed on church altars and ordered the people of Buenos Aires to wear red ribbons signifying their support. Anyone caught not wear ing the red ribbon might be beaten in the street. \r\n<br>\r\nIn the mid-1820s there were still some 6,000 slaves left in Buenos\r\nAires. The shortage of labour in the whole region of the Rio de la Plata\r\nencouraged slaveholders to retain as many slaves as they could. A\r\ncertain amount of slave trading as well as slaveholding took place in\r\nArgentina during the 1820s. It was tolerated for a while by the truculent\r\nFederalist caudillo Juan Manuel de Rosas, who ruled Buenos Aires from\r\n1829. Proximity to Brazil and conflicts with the Unitarians in Uruguay\r\ngave opportunities to the Brazilian slave-traders. But Rosas, whose\r\ndictatorship was to last until 1852, did not renounce the Manumission\r\nLaws. Moreover, he made a point of cultivating a following amongst\r\nthe urban blacks, whose fraternities and festivals he patronised. The\r\nnumbers of slaves and libertos steadily declined as a consequence of\r\nmilitary manumission and the working out of the 1813 law. Rosas saw\r\nhis mission as being to re-establish order, discipline and respect for the\r\nlanded proprietors. He was both ruthless and effective in pursuing this\r\ngoal. Slaveholding was eventually limited by the consequent check to\r\nrampant localism and preparedness to enforce legal contracts. Slaveholders\r\nwere at least obliged to respect the letter, if not the spirit, of the\r\nManumission Laws; in Mendoza a surprisingly large number of the few\r\nremaining slaves in 1853 were listed as being forty years old, so that\r\nthey just escaped being libertos.\r\n<br>\r\nIn 1833, a fraction of the federalists rebelled against Rosas and suffered defeat.\r\nThe vanquished, known as the Lomos negros [black backs] were expelled –\r\nturned proscriptos – and went into exile, mostly in Montevideo and some of\r\nthem in Chile. Many others arrived in Chile in the early 1840s, after a series of\r\nother failed attempts to overthrow Rosas.<br>\r\n\r\nRosas represented himself as a man of the people, able to identify with hard-riding gauchos of the pampa and poor black workers in the city while depicting his liberal opponents as effeminate Eurocentric aristocrats, out of touch with the real Argentina. The powerful ranchers of the pampa saw Rosas as one of them, and he protected their interests. For example, the nonsedentary indigenous people of the pampa remained unconquered in the mid-1800s. They had been pushed back by a line of forts, but they often raided herds and ranch houses. Rosas made war on the indigenous people to expand the territory\r\nopen to ranching, but he also negotiated with them skillfully, sometimes in their own language. Finally, Rosas won patriotic glory by defeating British and French interventions in the 1830s\r\nand 1840s.\r\n\r\nHe is overthrown after his defeat at the battle of Caseros. Shortly after the ejection of Rosas, all remaining slaves are freed.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike Brazil or Colombia, both public and private claims to new lands on\r\nthe expanding frontier in the Argentine pampas were made more effective\r\nby an initially unambiguous definition of formal property rights. In the\r\nprovince of Buenos Aires, the process of frontier expansion was in the first\r\ninstance a military operation that preceded settlement. Private settlers did\r\nnot wander out into the frontier in advance of government because of the\r\nthreat of hostile indigenous tribes. Instead, private interests pressured for\r\nmilitary campaigns to pacify the frontier to convert it into grazing land. This\r\nwas the principal reason for the rise of the caudillo dictator, Juan Manuel\r\nde Rosas. Military successes added vast tracts to the public domain, for\r\nwhich formal property rights were quickly defined and transferred to private\r\nhands, either by lease or sale, to raise government revenues and defray\r\nmilitary and other government costs. Like Brazil, population on the frontier\r\nwas sparse so that public lands were privatized in vast tracts. But, unlike\r\nBrazil, formalization of private property rights proceeded with greater regularity\r\nfrom the outset. The credibility of the government to make its claims\r\nto the public domain effective was a function of the public goods it provided\r\nin military services to pacify and defend frontier lands. Despite confiscations\r\nby Rosas that were nullified later, most property rights in land were\r\nwell defined. Over time, this facilitated development of active land and\r\nmortgage markets. Mortgage credit, in turn, was instrumental in, though\r\nnot solely responsible for, the extraordinary expansion of the Argentine\r\neconomy during its belle ´epoque of export-led growth prior toWorldWar I.	1829	1852	1	3		large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:54.567866	2015-02-13 04:07:54.567866	\N

60	Brazilian mining and immigration boom	<p class="entry columns" style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:9px;width:500px;position:relative;left:435px;">\r\n&emsp;In the eighteenth century, Brazilian production of the coveted metal exceeded the total volume of gold that Spain had taken from its colonies in two previous centuries. Adventurers and fortune hunters poured in. Brazil had 300,000 inhabitants in 1700; a century later, at the end of the gold years, the population had multiplied eleven times. No less than 300,000 Portuguese emigrated to Brazil in the eighteenth century, a larger contingent than Spain contributed to all its Latin American colonies. From the conquest of Brazil until abolition, it is estimated that some 10 million blacks were brought from Africa; there are no precise figures for the eighteenth century, but the gold cycle absorbed slave labor in prodigious quantities.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Salvador de Bahia was the Brazilian capital of the prosperous Northeastern sugar cycle, but the &quot;golden age&quot; in Minas Gerais moved the country's economic and political capital southward and Rio de Janeiro, the region's port, became the new capital in 1763. In the dynamic heart of the new mining economy, camps bloomed abruptly into cities, described by a contemporary colonial authority as &quot;sanctuaries for criminals, vagabonds, and malefactors,&quot; in a vertigo of easy riches. The &quot;Vila Rica de Ouro Preto&quot; (The &quot;Rich Town of Black Gold,&quot; so called because the mined gold turned black on exposure to the humid air, due to the presence of silver. -Trans.) had grown to city size by 1711; born of the miners' avalanche, it was the quintessence of the gold civilization. Simao Ferreira Machado, describing it twenty-three years later, said that the power of Ouro Preto businessmen surpassed by far that of Lisbon's most flourishing merchants: &quot;Hither, as to a port, are directed and collected in the Royal Mint the grandiose amounts of gold from all the Mines. Here dwell the best educated men, both lay and ecclesiastic. Here is the seat of all the nobility and the strength of the military. It is, by virtue of its natural position, the head of the whole of America; and by the wealth of its riches, it is the precious pearl of Brazil.&quot; Another writer of the period, Francisco Tavares de Brito, in 1732 defined Ouro Preto as &quot;the Potosi of gold.&quot;</p>	1701	1799	5	23	Open Veins of Latin America	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.588166	2015-02-13 04:07:54.588166	\N
496	To Carry Out Murder	<p class="entry "><img src="/mapimages/soawhisc.jpg" class="floatright">&quot;According to journalist Grace Livingstone, as of 2003 more Colombian School of the Americas graduates have been identified as alleged human rights abusers than SOA graduates from any other Latin American country.&quot;\r\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) concluded that the resulting military intelligence networks, organized and operating according to the US suggestions incorporated by <strong>Order 200-05/91</strong>, subsequently laid the groundwork for continuing an illegal, covert partnership between the military and paramilitaries. HRW argued that the restructuring process solidified linkages between members of the Colombian military and civilian members of paramilitary groups, by incorporating them into several of the local intelligence networks and by cooperating with their activities. In effect, HRW believed that this further consolidated &quot;<i>a secret network that relied on paramilitaries not only for intelligence, but to carry out murder</i>&quot;. Human Rights Watch argued that this situation allowed the Colombian government and military to plausibly deny links or responsibility for paramilitary human rights abuses. HRW stated that, far from diminishing violence, the military intelligence networks created by the U.S. reorganization appeared to have dramatically increased violence, citing massacres in Barrancabermeja as an example.&quot; </p>\r\n<p class="caption"><i>Pictured</i>, The School of Americas, cynically renamed Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation at Fort Benning, Georgia</p>	2003	2003	1	30		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.595848	2015-02-13 04:07:54.595848	\N

He also testified that the Army Intelligence School in Montevideo held weeklong\r\ntraining sessions in torture, practicing electric shocks, near-drownings, and other sadistic methods on prisoners.99 He said officers from Central America and Paraguay attended these “courses” and that Uruguayan officers also traveled to Panama—presumably to the U.S. Canal Zone base—for intelligence training.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Experiences"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="background:black;color:#FFFFFF;padding:15px;position:relative;top:50px">\r\nDr. Liber Mandressi, a forty-eight-year-old plastic surgeon, said he spent "eight years and forty-five days" in Libertad. He was arrested on December 16, 1975, which was around the time the mmilitary began in earnest to turn its attentions to the Communist Party, of which he was a member. (The Uruguayan Communist Party had previously enjoyed a long history as a distinguished, if marginal, participant in the country's democratic politics.) Dr. Mandressi was initially taken to an abandoned factory, behind the barracks of a mechanized-cavalry regiment that had been nicknamed El Infierno by its guests. "All of us were hooded all the time," he recalled. "And all of on were tortured for days on end, without even being interrogated at first. There must have been a hundred and fifty, two hundred people therm you could hear breathing, coughing, moaning—we weren't allowed to talk to each other. Occasionally your hood would slip a bit, but you could still see nothing. It was pitch-black. At one point, they kept us standing, our hands tied behind our backs, for four full days. One almost loses all sense of time in such situations, but four times I heard the birds outside chirping with the rising sun—that's how I know it was four days. Eventually, they'd take us in for their interrogations—beatings, shocks, <i>submarino</i> immersions. They weren't really after any information—they knew everything already, had everybody's name. It was all just part of the process. Once, I became aware that a seven-year-old boy had been brought in and was being forced to witness his parents' being tortured. I know I wasn't hallucinating—at the time, I thought I was—because I checked with others later, and they had all had the same hallucination." <strong> (A Miracle, A Universe by Lawrence Weschler)</strong>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<i>\r\nSubmarino consists of dunking a victim’s head into a vat filled with water, to which urine, excrement or other contaminants may have been added to increase the torment. This leads to a ‘‘near-drowning’’ experience in which victims are suffocated by having to hold their breath under water or inhaling the water, and which has been described as one of the most traumatic a human being can endure.  The physical consequences of submarino are usually short-lived, consisting mainly of uncontrollable coughing from the inhaled ‘‘water’’, but it can also cause acute brain damage due to deprivation of oxygen, as well as death from asphyxiation. The acute suffering produced during the immediate infliction of submarino is superseded by the often unbearable fear of repeating the experience.</i> <strong>(The International Committee of the Red Cross)</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Investigations"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="background:black;color:#FFFFFF;padding:15px;position:relative;top:350px">\r\nAn unknown number were disappeared and after the fall of the military dictatorship in 1985, amnesty was granted (including making it illegal to investigate the crimes of the state).

326	The U.S. Builds the Paramilitary Apparatus	<p class="entry columns">The Alliance for Progress programs of strengthening internal security forces took a still more ominous turn in El Salvador, with the establishment of the military and paramilitary apparatus that was to be responsible for widespread slaughter in coming years. According to Allan Nairn's detailed study (<A href="http://historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/nairnelsalvadorbtds.html" class="inline" target="_blank">Behind The Death Squads</a>), the US organized and trained the rural paramilitary force ORDEN, which has terrorized the countryside since, as well as the elite presidential intelligence service ANSESAL, which served as the intelligence arm of the &quot;death squads.&quot; The founder of ORDEN and ANSESAL, General Medrano, was enlisted as a CIA agent. Described by Jose Napoleon Duarte as &quot;the father of the Death Squads, the chief assassin of them all,&quot; he was awarded a silver medal by President Johnson &quot;in recognition of exceptionally meritorious service.&quot; Medrano stated that &quot;ORDEN and ANSESAL grew out of the State Department, the CIA, and the Green Berets during the time of Kennedy.&quot; Parallel domestic security agencies were established in Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, Honduras and Costa Rica and &quot;would meet every three months under the supervision of the State Department and exchange information and methods of operation,&quot; Medrano added.

By the time Delano had dressed and come topside the "strange ship," as he later described it, had slackened its sails and was now drifting with the wind toward an underwater ledge. To his puzzlement, it flew no flag. It looked to be in want and, if it drew closer to the shallows, in danger. Delano hastily had water, pumpkins, and fresh fish loaded in a boat. He then ordered it hoisted down and went on board.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe weather that morning was thick and breezy but the sun rose to reveal a calm bay. The other side of the island, from where the mysterious ship had appeared, was rough. Endless breakers, sharp-toothed underwater reefs, and steep rock-faced cliffs made its coastline unapproachable, providing sanctuaries for the seals that elsewhere had been hunted to near extinction. But the island's east, where the Perseverance harbored, was peaceful, the Southern Hemisphere's waning summer offering a harmony of lulling earth tones, brown, rich dirt, green sea, and cloudless blue skies. High bluffs blanketed by wild red thistles shielded a sandy, safe haven used by sealers and whalers to socialize, pass mailbags to ships bound home, and replenish wood and water.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAs he came closer, Delano could see the ship's name, the Tryal, painted in English in faded white letters along its bow. He could also see that its deck was full of black-skinned people, who looked to be slaves. And when he climbed on board, the alabaster-skinned New Englander discovered himself surrounded by scores of Africans and a handful of Spanish and mulatto sailors telling their "stories" and sharing their "grievances" in a babel of languages.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThey spoke in Wolof, Mandinka, Fulani, and Spanish, a rush of words indecipherable in its details but soothing to Delano in its generalities. Earlier, as his men rowed toward the ship, he could see that its sails were tattered. What should have been an orderly web of rigging and tackle was a wooly mash. Its hull, calcified, moss covered, and pulling a long trail of sea grass, gave off a greenish tint. But he knew it was a common pirates' ploy to make ships appear distressed in order to lure victims on board. Napoleon had just crowned himself emperor of the French, Madrid and Paris were at war with London, and privateers were raiding merchant ships at will, even in the distant South Pacific. Now, though, hollow cheeks and frantic eyes confirmed that the misery was real, turning Delano's fears into "feelings of pity."\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAmasa Delano was on board the Tryal for about nine hours, from around seven in the morning to a little after four in the afternoon. Having sent his away team back to the island to fill the Tryal's casks with water, he spent most of the day alone among its voyagers, talking with its captain, helping to distribute the food and water he had brought with him, and securing the ship so it didn't drift. Delano, a distant cousin of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, from a respected shipbuilding and fishing family on the Massachusetts coast, was an experienced mariner in the middle of his third sail around the world. Yet he couldn't see that it was the Tryal's slaves, and not the man who introduced himself as its master, who were in command.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Perserverance"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="background-image:url('/mapimages/oldpaper.jpg');position: relative; top: 85px; padding: 6px;">\r\n\r\n&emsp;\r\nLed by an older man named Babo and his son Mori, the West Africans had seized control of the Tryal nearly two months earlier and executed most of its crew and passengers, along with the slave trader who was taking them to Lima. They then ordered Benito Cerreno, the vessel's owner and captain, to sail them to Senegal. Cerreno stalled, afraid of rounding Cape Horn with only a handful of sailors and a ship full of mutinous slaves. He cruised first up and then down the Chilean coast, before running into Delano's Perseverance. The slaves could have fought or fled. Instead, Babo came up with a plan. The West Africans let Delano come on board and they acted as if they were still slaves. Mori stayed at Cerreno's side and feigned to be a humble and devoted servant. Cerreno pretended he was still in charge, making up a story about storms, doldrums, and fevers to account for the state of his ship and the absence of any officer besides himself.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nDelano didn't know what to make of Cerreno. He remained uneasy around him, even after he had convinced himself that he wasn't a brigand. Delano mistook Cerreno's vacant stare — the effect of hunger and thirst and of having lived for almost two months under a death threat, after having witnessed most of his crew being executed — for disdain, as if the aristocratic-looking Spaniard, dressed in a velvet jacket and loosely fitting black pants, thought himself too good to converse with a pea-coated New Englander. The West Africans, especially the women, also made Delano uncomfortable, though he couldn't say why. There were nearly thirty females on board, among them older women, young girls, and about nine mothers with suckling infants. Once the food and water had been doled out, the women took their babies and gathered together in the stern, where they began to sing a slow dirge to a tune Delano didn't recognize. Nor did he understand the words, though the song had the opposite effect on him than did the soothing mix of languages that had welcomed his arrival.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThen there was Cerreno's servant, Mori, who never left his master's side. When the two captains went below deck, Mori followed. When Delano asked Cerreno to send the slave away so they could have a word alone, the Spaniard refused. The West African was his "confidant" and "companion," he insisted, and Delano could speak freely in front of him. Mori was, Cerreno said, "captain of the slaves." At first, Delano was amused by the attentiveness Mori paid to his master's needs. He started, though, to resent him, vaguely blaming the black man for the unease he had felt toward Cerreno. Delano became fixated on the slave. Mori, he later wrote, "excited my wonder." Other West Africans, including Mori's father, Babo, were also always around, "always listening." They seemed to anticipate Delano's thoughts, hovering around him like a school of pilot fish, moving him first this way, then that. "They all looked up to me as a benefactor," Delano wrote in his memoir, A Narrative of Voyages and Travels in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, published in 1817, still, twelve years after the fact, confusing how he thought the rebels saw him that day with how they actually did see him.\r\n<br>&emsp;<i>After returning to the Perseverance, Delano orders an attack on the Tryal. After a pitched battle lasting hours, in which several of the slaves were captured, chained, tortured and killed (including Babo), the two ships are brought to the town of Talcahuano, where eleven of the ringleaders are brought to trial in in the inland town of conception. All will be found guilty, nine will be executed. </i>\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nYears later, a British consul in Concepcion, Henry William Rouse, recounted a story he heard when he first arrived in town: just before the trapdoor sprung and Mori's body fell through, the West African finally spoke. He damned the "cruel inhumanity of his captors, who, in the complete absence of the law steal men out of their homes."\r\n<br>&emsp; The corpses of the nine rebels were cut loose from the gallows and decapitated. Their heads were placed on pikes around the plaza and their bodies burned in a large pyre in its center. \r\n</p>	1805	1805	7	105	Greg Grandin's The Empire of Necessity	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.620851	2015-02-13 04:07:54.620851	\N

875	Pisagua	<p class="entry columns" style="background-color:white;padding:9px;position:relative;top:350px;">\r\n&emsp;The town of Pisagua is located on a lonely stretch of Chile's northernmost coast and can be visited only after a white-knuckle ride down a cliff road that in places seems to descend almost vertically. It was once an important port during the country's nineteenth-century nitrate boom, with a theater and a railway connecting it to the larger port of Iquique, seventy-five miles south. But after the nitrate industry's collapse, Pisagua, which in Spanish means <i>piss</i> and <i>water</i>, acquired a reputation as awful as its name. The town's remote location made it an ideal site for a penal colony, which would be opened and then abandoned several times during the twentieth century. And any prisoner foolhardy enough to attempt escape on foot would have faced almost certain death. The town borders the Atacama Desert, which is the driest place on earth. A few hundred people still live in the area, eking out a living by fishing, but most of Pisagua's buildings are abandoned.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Pisagua was used by the military regime of General Carlos Ibanez (1927-31) as a detention center for male homosexuals. Chile's first cold war president, Gabriel Gonzalez Vide la (1946-52), also utilized Pisagua as a prison during his brutal crackdown on the Chilean Communist Party. And Pinochet, who had been stationed and trained at the camp as a young army officer in the 1940s and then as a brigadier general in the late 1960s, made a similar use of Pisagua during his regime.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;On June 3, 1990 officials discovered an unmarked grave, <i>pictured</i>, containing the bodies of five prisoners. The site, near the Pisagua cemetery, had belonged to the Chilean army until recently. Those who buried the dead men had added lime to the soil in an effort to speed up the decomposition, but the dry, saline soil had practically mummified their bodies, preserving their clothes, bonds, blindfolds, and bullet wounds-an undeniable record of what had taken place.\r\n</p>	1927	1952	1	24	The General’s Slow Retreat: Chile after Pinochet  By Mary Helen Spoone	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.641857	2015-02-13 04:07:54.641857	\N

Sebastian Acevedo stood in the atrium on\r\nthe appointed day, emptied a pail full of gasoline over his\r\nbody, and warned the crowd gathered in the street that if\r\nanyone crossed the yellow line he would immediately set\r\nhimself on fire.

Headed by Cardinal Silva Henriquez and supported by all who fight for the return of democracy to Chile, it has\r\na moral influence difficult to counteract. The persecuted of all persuasions find refuge and human solidarity in the broad,\r\nsunny courtyard of its colonial building. The Vicariate is a reliable source of aid for those in need, particularly political prisoners and their families. Through it, cases of torture are denounced and campaigns are launched on behalf of the desaparecidos and against injustice of all kinds.\r\n<br>&emsp; [In 1985], threats by the dictatorship against the Vicariate had backfired. At the end of February 1985, three opposition militants were kidnapped with such a show of force that there could be no doubt who\r\nwas responsible. The sociologist Jose Manuel Parada, an officer\r\nof the Vicariate, was taken into custody in front of his\r\nchildren outside their school, with the traffic blocked off for\r\nthree blocks and the entire sector patrolled by army helicopters.\r\nThe other two activists were picked up in different parts\r\nof the city a few hours apart.

Gall noted further that The Santo Domingo newspaper El Nacional last December 30 filled a page and a half of newsprint with the details of 186 political murders and thirty disappearances during 1970. The Dominican terror resembles the current wave of political killings in Guatemala...in that the paramilitary death squads are organized by the armed forces and police, which in both cases over the years have been given heavy U.S. material and advisory support. The Wall Street Journal reported on September 9, 1971 that &quot;the conservative Catholic Church hierarchy has condemned the 'institutionalization' of terror.&quot; The Journal also claimed that the opinion was widespread in the Dominican Republic that the United States was behind the paramilitary death squads. Whether or not this specific allegation was true, the Journal observed that &quot;the embassy has done nothing publicly to dissociate itself from the terror. The U.S. continues to provide substantial aid, training, equipment, and arms, to the Dominican police and army.&quot;\r\n<br><i>Pictured</i>, The body of activist and engineer Amin Abel Hasbun, murdered on September 24, 1970 in the hallway outside his home, near his pregnant wife and two-year-old son.\r\n</p>	1970	1971	10	38	The Dominican Republic: U.S. Model for Third World Development Noam Chomsky & Edward Herman	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.672999	2015-02-13 04:07:54.672999	\N
20	The Conquest of Hunger and Disease	<p class="entry columns" style="width:570px;">&emsp;The harm done by the conquest was made worse by the obsession of each of the new rulers with gaining as much wealth as possible This led to bitter civil wars between rival Spanish Commanders and to risings of the newly rich settlers against representatives of the Spanish crown. As rival armies burned and pillaged, the irrigation canals and hillside terraces which had been essential to agriculture went to waste, the llama herds were slaughtered, the food stocks kept in case of harvest failure were eaten. The hungry were hit by the same European diseases which had caused so much harm in the Caribbean. The effect was even greater than that of the Black Death on 14th century Europe. In the valley of Lima only 2,000 out of a population of 25,000 survived in the 1540s (<i>Represented by the Pie Chart, right</i>). The indigenous population fell by between a half and three-quarters.</p>	1530	1540	2	65		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.681821	2015-02-13 04:07:54.681821	\N

847	Hurricaine Mitch	<p class="entry" style="position:relative;left:460px;padding:9px;background-color:white;width:510px;">\r\n&emsp;For a week in October 1998, Mitch parked itself over Central America, swallowing villages whole and killing more than 9,000. \r\nHurricane Mitch destroys 80 percent of the banana plantations\r\nin Honduras and damaged other crops and irrigation networks, bridges,\r\nroads, hospitals and schools in Nicaragua as well.\r\n<br>&emsp;In Honduras, grassroots organizations gained considerable\r\npolitical power after proving themselves capable of reconstruction\r\nefforts, when relief efforts in the wake of the Hurricane\r\noverwhelmed government agencies.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Already impoverished countries were desperate for reconstruction aid–and it came, but with strings attached. In the two months after Mitch struck, with the country still knee-deep in rubble, corpses and mud, the Honduran congress initiated what the Financial Times called “speed sell-offs after the storm.” It passed laws allowing the privatization of airports, seaports and highways and fast-tracked plans to privatize the state telephone company, the national electric company and parts of the water sector. It overturned land-reform laws and made it easier for foreigners to buy and sell property. It was much the same in neighboring countries: In the same two months, Guatemala announced plans to sell off its phone system, and Nicaragua did likewise, along with its electric company and its petroleum sector.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;All of the privatization plans were pushed aggressively by the usual suspects. According to the Wall Street Journal, “the World Bank and International Monetary Fund had thrown their weight behind the [telecom] sale, making it a condition for release of roughly $47 million in aid annually over three years and linking it to about $4.4 billion in foreign-debt relief for Nicaragua.”\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n	1998	1998	12	48	The Rise of Disaster Capitalism By Naomi Klein 	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.705786	2015-02-13 04:07:54.705786	\N

All political and union activities were suspended, wages were reduced by 60%, and dissidents were tortured by Nazi and U.S. trained military and police. Survivors say the torture rooms contained swastikas and pictures of Hitler, Mussolini and Franco. One year after Videla's coup, Amnesty International estimated 15,000 people had disappeared and many were in secret detention camps, but although the U.S. press admitted human rights abuses occurred in Argentina, Videla was often described as a &quot;moderate&quot; who revitalized his nation's troubled economy. \r\n<br>&emsp;Videla had a good public relations firm in the U.S., Deaver and Hannaford, the same firm used by Ronald Reagan, Taiwan, and Guatemala. Not surprisingly, his Economics Minister, Jose Martinez de Hoz, spoke, at Deaver's request, on one of President Reagan's national broadcasts in order to upgrade Argentina's reputation. Videla also received aid from WACL, the World Anti-Communist League, through its affiliate, CAL (Confederation Anticomunista Latinoamericana).<br>\r\nCAL sent millions of dollars to Argentina from sources such as the Italo-Argentine Masonic Lodge P-2, an outgrowth of old U.S. anti-communist alliances with the Italian drug mafia. As part of its WACL affiliation, Argentina trained Nicaraguan contras for the U.S. Videla left office in 1981, and after the Falklands Crisis of 1982 he and his cohorts were tried for human rights abuses by the new government.\r\n<br>&emsp;During the Process of National Reorganization—the military junta’s grandiose name for the period of its rule, from 1976 to 1983—as many as thirty thousand people, mostly young Argentines, were disappeared. The government justified its tactics as part of a war against a revolutionary insurrection waged by “subversive terrorists,” though the junta’s first leader, General Jorge Rafael Videla, defined a “terrorist” as “not only someone who plants bombs but a person whose ideas are contrary to Western, Christian civilization.” \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style="background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:9px;position:relative;top: 218px;left: 430px;width: 511px;font-size: .8em;"> &emsp;*"According to General Videla, a war had to be fought to destroy 'Godless communists' who threatened the security of the state. As in Guatemala, the definition of those who constituted this threat was inflated by the military: as Videla put it, 'a terrorist is not just someone with a gun or a bomb, but also someone who spreads ideas that are contrary to Western and Christian civilisation'. Elizabeth Jelin and Susana Kaufman argue that, used in these circumstances, the term 'war' is a misnomer. They concede that a leftist guerrilla movement was indeed engaged in 'widespread armed conflict' with right-wing paramilitary death-squads during the early 1970s; and that this conflict, together with the violence unleashed by the state before, during and after the coup, has been `defined by some as ... a "Dirty War" '. However, to use this name implies a particular interpretation - that 'both sides' shared responsibility for the violence - with which they are in disagreement. Argentina, they maintain, did not undergo a war, but a process of 'State Terrorism' undertaken by 'a state apparatus that resorted systematically to terror and repression of citizens and civil institutions without any respect for existing national and international juridical norms'. "\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="His Legacy"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry" style="background:white;width:400px;padding:9px; position: absolute; top: -16px; height: 700px;">\r\nThe junta’s security forces exceeded even that sweeping mandate when targeting dissidents for elimination. Sixty students from Manuel Belgrano High School, in Buenos Aires, were disappeared simply for having joined their student council. Victims were abducted as they stepped off buses, as they walked home from work or school, or in midnight raids of private residences and of the safe houses where members of guerrilla groups or of banned trade and student organizations lived in hiding. The abductees were taken to clandestine detention centers, where the majority of them were tortured and killed. \r\n<br>&emsp;Approximately thirty per cent of the disappeared were women. Some were abducted with their small children, and some, perhaps three per cent, were pregnant, or became so while in detention, usually through rape by guards and torturers. Pregnant prisoners were routinely kept alive until they’d given birth. “The regime’s depravity reached its outer limit with pregnant detainees,” Marguerite Feitlowitz, then a Harvard professor, wrote in her groundbreaking study of the Argentine nightmare, “Lexicon of Terror.” One former detainee told Feitlowitz, “Our bodies were a source of special fascination. They said my swollen nipples invited the ‘prod’ ”—the electric cattle prod, which was used in torture. “They presented a truly sickening combination—the curiosity of little boys, the intense arousal of twisted men.” \r\n<br>&emsp;Sometimes the mothers were able to nurse their newborns, at least sporadically, for a few days, or even weeks, before the babies were taken from them and the mothers were “transferred”—sent to their deaths, in the Dirty War’s notorious nomenclature. A common method of “transfer” was to inject the women with drugs and shove them from planes into the River Plate or the Atlantic. According to human-rights groups, as many as five hundred newborns and young children were taken from disappeared parents and handed over, their identities erased, to childless military and police couples and others favored by the regime.\r\n</p>	1976	1981	1	8	Children of the Dirty War by Francisco Goldman and the Friendly Dictators Trading Cards	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.960315	2015-02-13 04:07:54.960315	\N
231	Shooting Them Down	<p class="entry" style="width:390px;background-color:white;padding:9px;">\r\n&emsp;In December of 1907 there unfolded a great mining strike in the North. The nitrate workers opposed payment of wages in tokens and asked for less-miserable living conditions. 30,000 workers participated in the movement. The nitrate workers of the interior decided to go down to Iquique to explain their demands and thus exercise greater pressure. Nearly 15,000 workers mobilized, asking the government to intercede in the negotiations with the companies. In the port itself, other worker's associations which had caused work stoppage joined the movement.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Eduardo Galeano writes of this episode: <i>José Briggs, leader of the strike, is the son of a North American, but refuses to seek protection from the U.S. consul. The consul of Peru tries to save the Peruvian workers, but they won’t abandon their Chilean comrades. The consul of Bolivia tries to lure away the Bolivian workers. The Bolivian workers say: “With the Chileans we live, and with the Chileans we die.”</i>\r\n<br>&emsp; A state of siege was declared in the zone, and the government sent General Roberto Silva Renard to take command of the situation. On December 21st, the Chilean military arrived and gave the strikers an hour to leave. When they refused, the soldiers opened fire over the Escuela Santa Maria, killing what is believed were two thousand of the mineworkers, their wives and their children. This event constituted a hard blow for the northern workers and the <i>mancomunal</i> [labor brotherhood] movement.\r\n<br> <i>&emsp;This picture was taken moments before the massacre</i>\r\n</p>	1907	1907	10	27	 Salt in the Sand By Lessie Jo Frazier	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.752901	2015-02-13 04:07:54.752901	\N

This victory\r\ndirectly prepared the ground for the momentous conflict which ensued\r\nbetween the metropolis and the mainland colonies. During the wars\r\nlarge concessions had been made to the colonial assemblies. Efforts had\r\nbeen made to bring together the formerly localistic and fragmented\r\ncolonies in a common military effort. The defeat and disappearance of\r\nFrench power in mainland North America removed a powerful\r\nincentive to colonial subordination. The heady rhetoric of ‘patriotism’\r\nhad stimulated both colonial confidence and imperial assertiveness.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;The slaves of the Americas in 1770 were more intensively exploited\r\nthan any group of this size in history. Yet the immediate threat to\r\nempire came not from the exploited but from a colonial alliance\r\nincluding many of the exploiters. While imperial garrisons and\r\nsquadrons were sometimes available to subjugate slave revolts and\r\ncontain maroons the planters preferred to stamp out resistance by means\r\nof their own patrols and militia. Metropolitan forces had the primary\r\nfunction of protecting colonies from external attack. It is for this reason\r\nthat the British victory in North America in 1763 was too sweeping for\r\nits own good; it emancipated the colonists from their fear of the French\r\nand Spanish.\r\n</p>	1763	1763	1	72		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.785634	2015-02-13 04:07:54.785634	\N

General Alvarez, who according to Newsweek, &quot;doesn't care if officers are thieves, as long as they are virulent anti-communists,&quot; assisted in training programs and founded a special &quot;hit squad,&quot; the Cobras.

461	A Huge Open Wound	<p class="entry columns">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/carlosandresperezwef1989.jpg" class="floatright">&emsp;On February 27th, a wave of demonstrations shook Venezuela, angered by a series of IMF-requested free trade reforms by President Carlos Andres Perez, <i>pictured</i>,  that vastly increased the cost of living and privatized many state industries. \r\nThe bloody incident marked the start of a shift in the political scene, which saw the waning of the influence of the country's traditional parties and trade unions. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe last straw was an abrupt rise in bus fares, adopted in the wake of an increase in gas prices announced just after President Carlos Andres Perez (1974-1979 and 1989-1993) took office on Feb. 2, 1989. Unable to afford the new bus fares and facing serious difficulties in making it to their jobs in the second half of the month, commuters from outlying areas around Caracas were the first to erupt in anger, followed by thousands of people in slum neighbourhoods, vandals, and even police officers themselves. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe rioting and subsequent crackdown lasted a week. The clampdown on the protesters and looters was harsh after Tuesday the 28th, as the military was called out on the streets in several major cities and a curfew was set—measures that had not been used in Venezuela in several generations.  With the police and National Guard unable to restore order, Perez called out the army on the night of Monday, Feb. 27, and the troops brutally cracked down on the rioters, who were acting without clear objectives or political leadership of any kind. It is true as well, as journalists witnessed at the time, that the army also attempted on a number of occasions to at least impose order among the chaos, having looters stand in organised lines that filed in and out of supermarkets and stores, and ensuring that they only took food and did not cause damages. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n&quot;It was the first breakdown of the institutional pact under which democracy had functioned since 1958, a kind of collective decision to break with the prevailing state of law. But it was also a great national failure, a fight without winners, which remains a huge open wound,&quot; said sociologist Tulio Hernandez. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n The end result: hundreds of people killed, around 2,000 injured and more than 150 million dollars in damages to shops and businesses. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOn the 28th, Andres Perez suspended a number of constitutional civil liberties as the country had been effectively shut down within two days. The protests continued, and the military were sent in. Between 275 and 3,000 were killed, mostly civilians killed by the military and mercenaries.</p>	1989	1989	6	75		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.836103	2015-02-13 04:07:54.836103	\N

845	Congress passes the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act	1996 Congress passes the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act..\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\nThe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRAIRA) introduced the most sweeping changes to immigration enforcement since the 1952 Immigration and Naturalization Act, far outpacing the Immigra-tion Reform and Control Act and the Immigration Reform Act of 199o. Like prior immigration laws, it increased funding for border control as well internal enforce-ment activities. However, it also contained provisions that reinforced the immigration-related antiterrorism measures in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (A EDPA). It expedited removals of unauthorized migrants and increased the bar on reentry as well as limiting legal options for noncitizens charged with an immigration violation. It expanded the range of offenses that count as aggravated felonies for immigration/deportation purposes and made a number of immigration offenses prosecutable under the federal a ntiracketeering act (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations [RICO]), inaugurating a new point of intersection for immigration enforcement and federal law enforcement ef-forts. IIRAIRA expanded the grounds for exclusion for legal immigrants deemed to be a public charge, reinforcing the signals cent by the immigrant welfare re-strictions contained in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Recon-ciliation Act of 1996. It also gave immigration officers a greater degree of discretion in barring the entry of noncitizens and authorized memorandums of agreement allowing state law enforcement to partner with federal agencies in immigration enforcement, The latter introduced a legal precedent that supports present-day lo-cal enforcement practices, and the act in general promotes more rigorous and re-strictive admissions criteria for asylum seekers and noncitizens entering with temporary visas—primarily students and professional workers. </p>	1996	1996	1	106		large	f	2015-02-13 04:07:54.873286	2015-02-13 04:07:54.873286	\N
878	Lula Elected President	<p class="entries columns" style="background:white;padding:9px;position:relative;top:250px;">\r\n&emsp;\r\nIn 2002, a labor union leader with a fourth grade education named Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is elected president with 61 per cent of the popular vote. He runs on a platform that seems to both assure economic elites that he is willing to bargain, while telling audiences internationally: "Where we are in power, we turn neo-liberalism on its head. That’s our starting point. We start from the needs of the people, not the needs of capital.”\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entries columns3" style="background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:9px;position:relative;top:230px;">\r\n<strong>The Corruption Issue...</strong><br>\r\n\r\n&emsp;\r\nHis party,  the PT (<i>Partido dos Trabalhadores</i> or <i>Worker's Party</i>) got less than a fifth of the seats in Congress, where allies had to be found for the government to command a legislative majority. The head of Lula's cabinet had wanted to make a deal with the largest party of the centre, the PMDB (the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party), but this would have meant conceding important ministries. Lula preferred to stitch together a patchwork of smaller parties, whose bargaining power was weaker. But they naturally expected a share of the spoils too, if a lower grade one, and so the mensalão – the monthly backhander – was devised for them.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn cash terms, the corruption from which the PT benefited, and over which it presided, was probably more systematic than that of any predecessor. In absolute terms, Brazilian elections are second only to America’s in their costs, and relative to national income can exceed them by a wide margin. In 1996, Clinton spent $43 million to take the White House; in 1994 Cardoso laid out $41 million to secure the Palácio do Planalto, in a country with a per capita GDP less than a sixth that of the US. Unlike Cardoso, who twice sailed to victory on the first ballot as the establishment candidate, and commanded abundant natural – in Brazilian parlance, ‘physiological’ – allies and placemen in Congress, Lula was a three-time loser when he ran again for the presidency in early 2002, and his party traditionally an object of the deepest suspicion to all who counted economically in the country. To mount that unfavorable gradient, special resources were needed, for which special undertakings had to be given, public and private. So too, with a smaller core of deputies and fewer spontaneous friends in the legislature, to obtain makeshift majorities in Congress the PT was driven to bribe on a bigger scale.\r\n</p>	2002	2002	6	15	"Lula’s Brazil" by Perry Anderson (London Review of Books)	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.881744	2015-02-13 04:07:54.881744	\N

223	Colonization	<p class="entry columns">\r\n&emsp;After its military occupation of 1898, the U.S. Government imposes the Foraker act on the people of Puerto Rico, officially turning the nation into a U.S. Colony. The Foraker Act of 1900 created the office of governor, vested with absolute power and appointed by the president of the\r\nUnited States, assisted by an executive council at least five of whom had to be native inhabitants of the island, with the remaining six open to American appointees.\r\nThere would be an elected, thirty-five-member House of\r\nDelegates, but its decisions were subject to veto by either the governor or Congress. The only Puerto Rican who testified at a congressional\r\nhearing on the act was Julio Henna, a veteran civil rights campaigner.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n<font style="color:#cc0000">"No liberty, no rights, no protection,"</font> Henna said in an eloquent\r\nsummary of its provisions. <font style="color:#cc0000">"We are Mr. Nobody from Nowhere."</font>\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe Act also limits land holdings to no more than 500\r\nacres but this provision is ignored.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:.88em;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;position:relative;left:-10px;width:1000px;">\r\n<strong>Learning to Obey</strong><br>\r\n&emsp;In the words of Charles Eliot, president\r\nof Harvard University at the time of the 1898 colonial war, “I am inclined to the\r\nbelief that we shall be able to do Cuba and Porto Rico some good; though to do\r\nso we shall have to better very much our previous and existing practices in dealing\r\nwith inferior peoples.”\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nNotwithstanding these sentiments, to some Puerto Ricans the new colonial\r\npower offered possibilities for social justice and a democratic political system\r\nunimaginable under Spain. These people regarded the 1898 invasion with optimism.\r\nTheir idealization of the United States, however, would not be borne out.\r\nAfter nineteen months of military rule, on May 1, 1900, under the Foraker Act, the\r\noccupation forces a highly centralized civilian government under the\r\ndirect control of the U.S. federal government. With the exception of a brief period with local school boards, the educational system would become a similarly centralized structure led by a commissioner of education appointed by the president\r\nof the United States until 1948.\r\nThe authority of the commissioner extended to the\r\nNormal School, established in 1900, and the University of Puerto Rico, founded in\r\n1903. Thus, contrary to its tradition of decentralized governance, the U.S. state\r\ncoming out of the 1898 war opted instead to govern its new colonies in the centralized\r\nmanner in which it governed the affairs of its Native American societies.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn the wake of its military victory in 1898, the U.S. government initiated what\r\nthe dominant discourse called a “civilizing,” “Americanizing,” or “assimilationist”\r\nmission. A crucial step in this mission was to grind down or “pulverize” the constituent\r\nelements of the conquered peoples’ cultural identities. In 1902 Samuel\r\nMcCune Lindsay, the commissioner of education of Puerto Rico, noted, “Colonization\r\ncarried forward by the armies of war is vastly more costly than that carried\r\nforward by the armies of peace, whose outpost and garrisons are the public\r\nschools of the advancing nation.”\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe process of reacculturation went hand in hand with the steps taken to\r\ndestroy the cultural identity of the conquered peoples. The Puerto Rican poet\r\nand political activist Juan Antonio Corretjer (1908–89) described those who were\r\nsubjected to the educational policies and practices of the early years of occupation\r\nand conquest as “the most tortured generation.” To this end, the United\r\nStates established a public system of “American” schools and an “American” curriculum\r\nin Puerto Rico in 1898, which included the stated goal of having English\r\nas the primary language of teaching and learning, a policy that lasted until 1948.\r\nA year later, in 1899, the colonial government established a series of scholarships\r\nfor vocational and university study in the United States. In 1900 a Normal\r\nSchool for teacher education was founded, following the model already in use\r\nin the United States for the education of Indians and African Americans. On\r\nMarch 12, 1903, the United States founded the University of Puerto Rico, in which\r\nEnglish was the official language of instruction until 1942.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n<img src="/mapimages/puertoricocaguasschool.jpg" class="floatleft" style="max-width:70%;">\r\nTeacher training became one of the main priorities of government officials in\r\nWashington and San Juan in this period. One hundred and twenty English teachers\r\nfrom the United States were sent to Puerto Rico to assist in the establishment\r\nof English as the language of instruction on the island. The Department of Education\r\norganized summer institutes for the education of teachers following the\r\nmodel used for similar programs at the Hampton Institute in Virginia and the\r\nTuskegee Normal and Industrial School in Alabama. In addition, as it did in 1900,\r\nwhen 1,273 public school teachers from Cuba were sent to Harvard University for\r\na summer of training in the English language and for the study of educational\r\ntheories and practices, 540 public school teachers from Puerto Rico were sent to\r\nHarvard and Cornell University in 1904 to participate in a similar summer program.\r\nThe magnitude of the summer programs at Harvard and Cornell in 1900\r\nand 1904 is evidenced by the fact that 1,273 teachers in 1900 represented more\r\nthan 40 percent of the Cuban teaching corps and the 540 Puerto Rican teachers\r\nrepresented 47 percent of the teachers in service in 1904.\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The picture, from roughly 1900, is captioned "America's greatest gift to Porto Rico - the public school, Caguas"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class="entry_source">The Imperial Enterprise and Educational Policies in Colonial\r\nPuerto Rico by pablo navarro-rivera</span>\r\n</p>	1900	1900	9	67		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:54.969991	2015-02-13 04:07:54.969991	\N

Nevertheless, in the face of growing pressure, the Eisenhower administration demonstrated some commitment to fighting unregulated immigration by announcing the start of its infamous Operation Wetback on June 9, 1954.\r\n<br>&emsp; Led by INS Commissioner General Joseph Swing, the operation involved the massive roundup of suspected &ldquo;wetbacks&rdquo; in border states.

That Providence Island settlement only lasted a little over a decade as constant friction between Spain and England made it difficult to support these isolated colonies.\r\n<br>&emsp; From the early seventeenth century, British colonists ruled what is now the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua and Honduras, in defiance of Spanish pretensions to control the entire isthmus. <a data-entry="524" data-year="1678" class="inline">Around 1680 the British crowned a Miskitu leader as king</a>,\r\ngiving rise to an institution known as the Mosquito Kingdom, which became\r\nthe linchpin of British indirect rule for the next 200 years.

750	Alvarez ousted in honduras	<p class="entry columns" style="position:relative;left:588px;width:500px">\r\n&emsp;<strong>MARCH 31 1984</strong> Gustavo Álvarez Martínez ousted in Honduras. Álvarez was a fierce anti-Communist who detested the Sandinista movement that had recently come to power in neighboring Nicaragua. When the Reagan administration asked him to turn Honduras into a base for anti-Sandinista rebels, known as contras, he eagerly agreed. Soon hundreds of contras were operating from camps along the Nicaraguan border, and thousands of American soldiers were flying in and out of the ballooning Aguacate air base nearby. From 1980 to 1984, annual United States military aid to Honduras increased from $4 million to $77 million. Once again, it had surrendered its national sovereignty to Americans. \r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Rivals forced General Alvarez from power in 1984 but did not dismantle his repressive machine. It had two purposes: supporting the contras and repressing dissent within Honduras. To achieve this latter goal, the army established a secret squad called Battalion 3-16, trained and supported by the CIA, that maintained clandestine torture chambers and carried out kidnappings and killings. The most powerful figure in the country during this period was the American ambassador, John Negroponte, who studiously ignored all pleas that he try to curb the regime's excesses. \r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;<font style="color:#cc0000">After his expulsion, Álvarez works for the Pentagon before being assassinated in 1989.</font>\r\n</p>	1984	1984	4	83	Overthrow by Stephen Kinzer	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:55.013402	2015-02-13 04:07:55.013402	\N

In the months before CAFTA’s approval, popular mobilizations highlighted the people’s rejection of the trade agreement. They were met with violent police repression and a multi-million dollar government funded pro-CAFTA campaign. The final approval by El Salvador’s Legislative Assembly took place in a midnight session fraught with deal-making and surrounded by hundreds of riot police to keep the protesters at bay.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAlmost five years later, basic living costs have skyrocketed as CAFTA has destroyed the already-neglected agricultural sector and one of the most insidious parts of CAFTA—the investor protection clauses—is just now being revealed. Chapter 10 of the trade agreement contains the articles that allow foreign corporations to sue governments for violating their “right” to profit. Economists like Raul Moreno from El Salvador’s Foundation for the Study of the Application of Law (FESPAD) have been warning the public about these articles since the beginning. Moreno explains that these articles are “the real attack on national sovereignty. If a country takes an action or creates a law to protect its citizens, to protect its workers, or to protect its environment, a foreign company can now sue the country for infringing on their profits.”\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn April 2009, Canadian-based Pacific Rim became the first company operating in El Salvador to file such a lawsuit under CAFTA, suing the country for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. The company is alleging that the government violated CAFTA’s investor protection clauses by not issuing the company mining exploitation permits. As a Canadian company, Pacific Rim is not a party to CAFTA, but it filed the suit through a Reno-based subsidiary that they acquired just before deciding to sue.\r\n</p>	2004	2004	5	38	<span style="background:white;padding:9px;">Resisting CAFTA and Metal Mining in El Salvador  By Leah Wilson<span>	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:55.027959	2015-02-13 04:07:55.027959	\N

397	The Entire Honduran Government	<p class="entry columns" style="padding:9px;background:white;">\r\n&emsp;From 1978-1982 the dictatorial regime was headed by yet another School of Americas grad, Policarpo Paz Garcia, who intensified repression by Battalion 3-16, one of the most feared death squads in the Americas. General Humberto Regalado Hernandez, who was inducted into the School Of Americas' Hall of Fame, was a four-time graduate. As head of the armed forces, he refused to take action against soldiers involved in the Battalion 3-16 death squad. \r\n <br>\r\n&emsp;In 1981, the DEA set up its first office in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, and assigned Thomas Zepeda as the resident agent. Zepeda rapidly came to the accurate conclusion that the entire Honduran government was deeply involved in the drug trade. His attempts to investigate top Honduran officials whom he believed were on Matta's drug payroll were thwarted by the CIA. We know this because Zepeda was quoted as saying as much in a good story in the Los Angeles Times on February 13, 1988 (<i>See below</i>). In May 1983, Zepeda opened an investigation into SETCO. A month later the probe was cut off, Zepeda was pulled out of Honduras, and the DEA's Honduran station was shut down. The man responsible for this retreat was Ed Heath, the DEA's head of Latin American operations, resident in Mexico City and suspected by many DEA agents of being too cozy with the CIA. Former DEA agent Michael Levine described Heath as being &quot;a man so mistrusted by the street agents working for him in Mexico that they conducted enforcement operations without informing him.&quot;\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;In 1985, the GAO was requested to explore the reasons why the DEA shut down the Honduran office. This investigation was also quashed by the NSC and CIA.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n<strong>U.S. Aides Link Honduran Military Chief, Drug Trade</strong> (<i>Excerpt</i>)\r\n<br> &emsp;\r\n Honduras' powerful military chief, Gen. Humberto Regalado Hernandez, is suspected of protecting Colombian drug traffickers who use his country for transshipping cocaine into the United States, Reagan Administration officials said Friday.\r\n<br> &emsp;\r\nAs head of a force that includes Honduras' small navy, which runs the Central American country's Caribbean ports, Regalado "turned a blind eye to drug shipments," a knowledgeable State Department official said. "We can only presume he was paid a price for that. He wasn't doing it out of the goodness of his heart."\r\n<br> &emsp;\r\nThe allegations against Regalado, which stem from U.S. intelligence reports, are only part of a mounting body of evidence that senior members of the military in Honduras, a key U.S. ally in the Contras' war against leftist Nicaragua, are deeply involved in the international cocaine trade, the officials said.\r\n<br> &emsp;\r\n"We don't know the extent of the Honduran military's involvement in drugs," said the State Department official. "But our educated guess is that <strong>all of the senior officers have knowledge, many are involved . . . and they are all reaping the profits.</strong>"\r\n<br> &emsp;\r\n...\r\n<br> &emsp;\r\nSeveral knowledgeable U.S. officials described the situation in Honduras as a minor-league parallel to the case of Panama, where military strongman Manuel A. Noriega allegedly protected billions of dollars in drug trade.\r\n<br> &emsp;\r\n...\r\n<br> &emsp;\r\nBut just as in Panama, the CIA and other U.S. agencies initially resisted investigating the problem, officials said, because they had a major stake in maintaining good relations with the Honduran armed forces--in this case, because Honduras hosts the main bases of the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan Contras.\r\n<br> &emsp;\r\nOne official said that DEA agents informally proposed impaneling a grand jury to investigate Honduran officials in the early 1980s, but that the CIA blocked the move. His account could not be confirmed.\r\n<br>\r\n<span style="text-align: right;\r\nfont-weight: bold;\r\nfont-size: 11px;\r\nfont-family: helvetica, sans-serif;\r\ntext-transform: uppercase;">\r\n\r\nFebruary 13, 1988 by DOYLE McMANUS and RONALD J.

455	A Popular Rejection	<p class="entry columns" style="position:relative;left:350px;background-color:white;top:-10px;padding:10px;width:630px;">&emsp;In 1988, Costa Rica expels the Contras. Having had decades of peace and stability, Costa Rica and Honduras became the bases for the CIA-formed counterrevolutionary rebels, known as the Contras, in a proxy war against the Sandinistas. By now, the Contras had been engaged in the smuggling of cocaine and guns, once the CIA had begun funding them through illicit means after Congress officially cut their financing. They had offices in Costa Rican cities, and military bases on its side of the border with Nicaragua. Tens of thousands of Costa Ricans took to the streets to demand their country's disentanglement from the war, and President Oscar Arias Sanchez had participated in the five nation Contadora talks. On January 14th, Arias demanded Contras in his country retire from the war and belligerent organizations or leave the country.<br>\r\n<span class="caption"> <i>Pictured</i>, a Contra Southern Front camp</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="columns3" style="position:relative;left:350px;top:-22px;background-color:white;padding:10px;width:630px;"><strong><i>Excerpt of</i> Costa Rica in Ultimatum to Contras</strong>\r\n<br>&emsp;Rebel (<i>Contra</i>) officials and American diplomats were stunned by Mr. Arias's move, announced Tuesday night. The rebels have previously been allowed to conduct political activities in Costa Rica and have maintained a major office here.\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;The sudden ultimatum is one of several developments that appear to have been prompted by the meeting here this Friday of five Central American Presidents, who will judge compliance with the regional peace accord they signed five months ago in Guatemala.\r\n<br>&emsp;In a second step that appeared directed at balancing his move against the rebels, Mr. Arias tonight sent a strongly worded letter to the Nicaraguan President, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, criticizing him for not doing more to comply with the treaty.\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;...\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThis morning the police briefly detained Alfonso Robelo and Alfredo Cesar, two senior rebel officials who have lived in Costa Rica since 1982, when they flew here after attending a meeting in Guatemala. The two are widely seen as the most politically moderate rebel leaders and have been friends of Mr. Arias for years.\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;''This has grave implications,'' Mr. Robelo said after being released.\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;Mr. Arias reinforced his decision today by making public a letter he wrote to rebel leaders Tuesday night.\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;''When some of you expressed to me your support of the peace plan I thought you had abandoned your participation in favor of an armed solution to the conflict afflicting the Nicaraguan family,'' he wrote.

610	Inter-American Development Bank Founded	<p class="entry columns" style="position:relative;top:105px;padding:9px;background:white;">&emsp;Inter-American Development Bank forms to channel multilateral grants and loans to Latin America. The IADB has regularly served as a tool of US foreign policy: \r\n<br>&emsp; Against Chile under Allende, the United States representative at the Inter-American Development Bank was instructed to block all proposals for loans to Chile. When the bank's president protested, the administration forced his resignation. The new president reduced Chile's credit rating from B to D. Private banks followed suit, and the Export-Import Bank, citing the reduction, canceled a scheduled $21 million loan intended to pay for new Boeing jets for Chile's national airline. \r\n<br>&emsp; And against Nicaragua under the Sandanistas, the Nicaraguan government sent a loan request to the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in 1985 requesting $100 million to develop its private-sector agriculture. Then US Secretary of State George Shultz sent a letter to the bank threatening to withdraw US support for the bank if the loan was made, but gave no reason as to why this would be the case. A senior IDB official later remarked: &quot;I have never seen such political pressure on the bank as in the last four years.&quot; The blocking of this loan illustrates the hypocrisy of the Reagan administration as the private agricultural sector was the very area that Washington had said it had hoped to preserve against an alleged Marxist takeover. \r\n<br>&emsp; But not all countries have been punished: the brutal Junta in El Salvador was well financed by the bank during both the Carter and Reagan administrations.\r\n</p>	1959	1959	5	74	America’s Other War: Terrorizing Colombia by Doug Stokes and Overthrow: America's Century of Regime From  Hawaii to Iraq by Stephen Kinzer	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:55.073879	2015-02-13 04:07:55.073879	\N

648	Paraguay Charged with Genocide against Indigenous	<div class="page" data-title="The Complaint"></div>\r\n<p class="entry" style="width:215px;position:absolute;left:795px;top:5px">&emsp;\r\nIn 1974, the International League for the Rights of Man and the Inter-American Association for Democracy and Freedom issued the charge that the government of Paraguay was complicit in genocide against the Guayaki Indians (Ach&eacute;). In doing so, the two organizations &#64257;led a complaint with the United Nations secretary-general in which they listed a series of alleged violations that they claimed would ultimately lead to the disappearance of the Guayaki ethnic group. Most of the killings&mdash;as well as the forcible transfer of Ach&eacute; children&mdash;had been committed by Paraguayan ranchers, farmers, and laborers and not by members of the Paraguayan army or police forces. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nSome scholars and activists argued at the time that de facto genocide had occurred and that the Paraguayan government was responsible due to the fact that it had failed to adequately protect its citizens. It was also argued that the Paraguayan government purposely disregarded the actions against the Ach&eacute; because it\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Genocide"></div>\r\n<p class="entry" style="width:215px;position:absolute;left:795px;top:5px">\r\n favored the opening up of lands for ranching, farming, and other \r\nuses. During the debate that ensued over the plight and fate of the Ach&eacute;, it was argued by some that the issue of the &ldquo;intent&rdquo; to commit genocide was difficult, if not impossible, to establish in a clear and decisive manner. Leo Kuper (1908&ndash;1994), an early and noted genocide scholar, countered in his book <i>Genocide: Its Political Use in the Twentieth Century</i>, that intent could be imputed when such killings and kidnapping had become an established practice, and, he continued, the latter is exactly what the Ach&eacute; had faced.\r\n\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n<i>Pictured, Aché Indians shortly after they were captured and brought out of the forest to the Aché Reservation.

Before that, according to former Costa Rican CIA station chief Thomas Castillo's public testimony, Hull had helped the CIA with military supply and other operations on behalf of the Contras.  In addition, during the same period, Hull received $10,000 a month from Adolfo Calero of the FDN&#8212;at North's direction.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nHull is an Indiana farmer who lives in northern Costa Rica. He came to Costa Rica in mid-1970's and persuaded a number of North Americans to invest in ranch land in the northern part of the country. Using their money and adding some of his own, he purchased thousands of acres of Costa Rican farm land. Properties under his ownership, management or control ultimately included at least six airstrips. To the many pilots and revolutionaries who passed through the region, this collection of properties and airstrips became known as John Hull's ranch.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOn March 23, 1984, seven men aboard a U.S. government owned DC-3 were killed when the cargo plane crashed near Hull's ranch, revealing publicly that Hull was allowing his property to be used for airdrops of supplies to the Contras. But even before this public revelation of Hull's role in supporting the Contras, officials in a variety of Latin American countries were aware of Hull's activities as a liaison between the Contras and the United States government. Jose Blandon testified, for example, that former Costa Rican Vice President Daniel Oduber suggested he (Blandon) meet with Hull in 1983, to discuss the formation of a unified southern Contra command under Eden Pastora.\r\nFive witnesses testified that Hull was involved in cocaine trafficking: Floyd Carlton, Werner Lotz, Jose Blandon, George Morales, and Gary Betzner. Betzner was the only witness who testified that he was actually present to witness cocaine being loaded onto planes headed for the United States in Hull's presence.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nLotz said that drugs were flown into Hull's ranch, but that he did not personally witness the flights. He said he heard about the drug flights from the Colombian and Panamanian pilots who allegedly flew drugs to Hull's airstrips. Lotz described the strips as "a stop for refuel basically. The aircraft would land, there would be fuel waiting for them, and then would depart. They would come in with weapons and drugs." Lotz said that Hull was paid for allowing his airstrips to be used as a refueling stop.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nTwo witnesses, Blandon and Carlton recounted an incident involving the disappearance of a shipment of 538 kilos of cocaine owned by the Pereira or Cali cocaine cartel. Teofilo Watson, a member of Carlton's smuggling operation, was flying the plane to Costa Rica for the Cartel. The plane crashed and Watson was killed. The witnesses believed that the crash occurred at Hull's ranch and that Hull took the shipment and bulldozed the plane, a Cessna 310, into the river. Carlton testified that the Colombians were furious when they discovered the cocaine missing. He said they sent gunmen after Hull and in fact kidnapped a member of Hull's family to force the return of the cocaine. When that failed they became convinced that Carlton himself stole the cocaine and they sent gunmen after him. The gunmen dug up Carlton's property in Panama with a backhoe looking for the lost cocaine, and Carlton fled for his life to Miami.<br>\r\n<Span class="caption">The Senate Committee Report on Drugs, Law Enforcement and Foreign Policy chaired by Senator John F.

327	The Kennedy-Yarborough strategy 	<p class="entry columns"><img src="/mapimages/williamyarborough.jpg" class="floatright" style="max-width:50%;">\r\n&emsp;\r\nThe respected president of the Colombian Permanent Committee for Human Rights, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Alfredo Vasquez Carrizosa, writes that it is “poverty and insufficient land reform” that “have made Colombia one of the most tragic countries of Latin America,” though as elsewhere, “violence has been exacerbated by external factors,” primarily the initiatives of the Kennedy administration, which “took great pains to transform our regular armies into counterinsurgency brigades.” These initiatives ushered in “what is known in Latin America as the National Security Doctrine,” which is not concerned with “defense against an external enemy” but rather “the internal enemy.” The new “strategy of the death squads” accords the military “the right to fight and to exterminate social workers, trade unionists, men and women who are not supportive of the establishment, and who are assumed to be communist extremists.”\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;\r\nAs part of its strategy of converting the Latin American military from “hemispheric defense” to “internal security”—meaning war against the domestic population—Kennedy dispatched a military mission to Colombia in 1962 headed by Special Forces General William Yarborough, <i>pictured</i>. He proposed “reforms” : <span style="color: #cc0000;background-color:black;font-family:helvetica,arial,san-serif;">“A concerted country team effort should be made now to select civilian and military personnel for clandestine training in resistance operations in case they are needed later. This should be done with a view toward development of a civil and military structure for exploitation in the event the Colombian internal security system deteriorates further. This structure should be used to pressure toward reforms known to be needed, perform counter-agent and counter-propaganda functions and as necessary execute paramilitary, sabotage and/or terrorist activities against known communist proponents. It should be backed by the United States.”</span>—the “communist extremists” to whom Vasquez Carrizosa alludes.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&emsp;&quot;Every individual who in one or another manner supports the goals of the enemy must be considered a traitor and treated in that manner,&quot; a 1963 Colombian military manual prescribed, as the Kennedy initiatives were moving into high gear. Since the official goals of the guerrillas are social democratic, the circle of treachery targeted for terror operations is wide.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;In the years that followed, the Kennedy-Yarborough strategy was developed and applied broadly in &quot;our little region over here,&quot; as the Western hemisphere was described by FDR's Secretary of War Henry Stimson when he was explaining why the US was entitled to control its own regional system while all others were to be dismantled. Violent repression spread throughout Latin America, beginning in the southern cone and reaching its awesome peak in Central America in the 1980s as the stern disciplinarian of the North responded with extreme violence to efforts by the Church and other &quot;subversives&quot; to confront a terrible legacy of misery and repression.</p>	1963	1963	1	30	The Culture of Fear, Noam Chomsky	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:55.220677	2015-02-13 04:07:55.220677	\N
880	Lempira	<p class="entry columns">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/honduraslempira.jpg" class="floatright">\r\n<font style="color:#cc0000">&emsp;Native Hondurans had long resisted Spanish invasion and\r\nenslavement, and in 1537, a young Lenca chief named Lempira led an\r\nindigenous uprising against the Spanish. Inspired by Lempira's example,\r\nrevolt swept the western region, and the Spanish were very nearly\r\nexpelled.</font>\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOnce the Inca Empire and gold and silver was discovered in the 1530s, the demand for slaves\r\nintensified. Slaves served as crew on the ships to Peru; slaves, even when\r\nnot trusted to fight in the conquest of Peru, functioned as human carriers,\r\nminers, servants, and mistresses, until the Inca themselves could\r\nbe subdued and enslaved. Hundreds of thousands of slaves were sold\r\nand exported to Peru; the number is not known with any certainty, but\r\nsome estimate that as many as a half million Nicaraguans and 150,000\r\nHondurans were exported as slaves. Yet the demand for more remained\r\nhigh; conditions were so wretched aboard ship that in many cases only\r\nfour in every 20 Indian slaves reached their destination alive; those that\r\ndid reach Panama or Peru were literally worked to death. The Indian\r\npopulation in Nicaragua proved inadequate to meet demand. Raids for\r\nable-bodied adults extended down into the Nicoya Peninsula and up\r\ninto El Salvador and Guatemala.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nSome Indians fled to remote regions in the Nicaraguan highlands or\r\nthe forested regions of the Caribbean coast and the Petén. Those who\r\nremained in their towns had little to lose by rebelling, and they did so\r\nfrom their first contact with the Spaniards. The most famous uprising\r\noccurred in Honduras, in the center of the Caribbean slave trade, and was\r\nled by Lempira, the legendary chief of the Lenca Indians, who organized\r\n200 towns and successfully coordinated 30,000 warriors against the\r\nSpanish in 1537; his success inspired rebellions in most of Honduras. The\r\nSpaniards assassinated Lempira during peace negotiations a year later,\r\nbut rebellions continued to erupt in Honduras, El Salvador, and\r\nNicaragua. Indians along the frontier of Spanish settlements mounted\r\nsuccessful guerrilla attacks for years and, in some instances, centuries. African slaves were introduced in the 1540s to fill the growing\r\nlabor shortage.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn 1931, Honduras renamed its currency in his honor.\r\n</p>	1536	1537	2	48		large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:55.229134	2015-02-13 04:07:55.229134	\N

Although a very moderate program, the fruit companies shut down Honduran jobs in order to force the government to dilute the measures. The program was revived in 1972 by General Oswaldo López Arellano, who also initiated a National Development Plan. However, he was forced from office and replaced by a military clique that swiftly moved to repress the workers and activists. Two foreign priests and a number of peasant leaders were massacred by the army at Los Horcones in 1975.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n In September of 1974, Hurricane Fifi destroyed 60% of Honduras' agricultural production, and Standard Fruit abandoned many of it's plantations. the idled banana workers responded by organizing Las Isletas Peasants Enterprise, whose members planted and harvested bananas collectively and shared the profits. Las Isletas processed over one million boxes of bananas in 1976 and four million in 1977, selling the produce to Standard Fruit. But when Las Isletas decided to market its fruit through the Union of Banana Exporting Countries, Standard pressured the Honduran government to arrest 200 militant members of Las Isletas and ransack the association's headquarters. The Honduran soldiers arrived in Standard Fruit's railroad cars. The successful Las Isletas banana cooperative was destroyed.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n	1977	1977	5	83	Truth, Torture, and the American Way By Jennifer Harbury	large	t	2015-02-13 04:07:55.241796	2015-02-13 04:07:55.241796	\N

111	Bahia Revolt of 1807	<p class="entry columns"><img src="/mapimages/brazil-1807-bahia-slaves.jpg" class="floatright" style="max-width:50%;">\r\n&emsp;The 1807 Bahia rebellion was foiled by the Province government, who had been tipped off by a slave loyal to his master. According to the reports, urban and rural slaves had conspired to join forces to make &quot;War on whites.&quot; Supposedly, they had even planned to capture some of the ships moored in the harbor at Bahia as part of a massive voyage for their anticipated return to Africa. However, the purported goals of the rebel leadership, as related by government sources, represent an extravagant plan that epitomized the fabrications of certain police captains and an inventive spy. \r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;The Hausa (Malê), both slave and free, performed a major role in organizing the revolt. Among the Hausa people, Islam was widely practiced, and the Hausa were well represented within the slave population of Bahia at the time and were considered responsible for many early 19th century rebellions. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAn intricate secret organization appears to have existed among the rebels, with a "captain" in every parish of the city and an overall commander, known as the "ambassador." Both of the principal leaders of the insurrection who were executed, one a slave and the other a free black, were Hausa. The other eleven individuals who were involved in the plot were punished publicly with 150 lashes each to provide an example for those who empathized with the rebels and potential insurectionists. In addition to the floggings, the provincial governor banned all assemblies and festivities that involved Africans and severely restricted the movement of freed Africans in Salvador and Reconcavo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:x-small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n&emsp;Divided by color and place of birth, by juridical status and hope of\r\nimprovement, slaves and free people of color did not for the most part\r\nmake common cause. The war against slavery in Bahia was a war\r\ncarried out or led after 1798 almost exclusively by African slaves and by\r\nthose freed persons of African birth for whom ethnicity was more vital\r\nthan juridical status.\r\n<br>&emsp;It is impossible to make a sharp break between the current of endemic\r\nresistance and the outbreak of insurrections around the turn of\r\nthe century. The uprising and flight of the slaves of Engenho Santana\r\nin 1789 was perhaps an early manifestation of the new cycle of resistance,\r\nalthough in that case the leadership was crioulo or cabra and\r\nthere were clear signs of competition with Africans. By 1795, royal\r\nofficials and rural residents were concerned about an increase in fugitive\r\nactivities. Two quilombo settlements in the region of Cachoeira\r\nmoved the government to action. Plantations had been burned, property\r\nstolen, and other slaves induced to run off. The governor dispatched\r\nSeverino Pereira, captain-major of assaults of Itapororocas,\r\nand 200 men to attack the well-fortified mocambo in the Orobó Mountains.\r\nTwo encampments, Orobó and Andrah, were destroyed and\r\nthirteen slaves taken captive, but a great number escaped to another\r\nquilombo, Tupim. The expedition was a traditional response to a\r\nrecurring problem, but the problem seemed to intensify in the opening\r\nyears of the nineteenth century. The governor of Bahia, Joao de Saldanha\r\nda Gama, count of Ponte, launched an active campaign against\r\nquilombos all over the captaincy. In Rio das Contas, the captain of\r\nassaults and a troop of Indians from the Pedra Branca mission were\r\nsent to destroy quilombos in the area but failed. Poor farmers accused\r\nPonte sought to stem the rising tide of resistance because he understood\r\nits potential threat to the captaincy's economy and tranquility.\r\nAlthough 1809 is usually taken as the beginning of the cycle of Bahian\r\nslave rebellions, a plot was uncovered in 1807. The Hausas had\r\nelected a "governor" who had as his "secretary" a free pardo. The\r\npardo had been dispatched to the Reconcavo to enlist the engenho\r\nslaves for a concerted uprising; but when the plot was exposed, the\r\ngovernor threw guards around the city's fountains because of a supposed\r\nthreat to poison the drinking water. The Hausa leaders were\r\ntried for having violated the rights of their masters and for disrupting\r\n"the public tranquillity on which the conservation of states depends. "\r\nA slave and a freedman were sentenced to death, and eleven others\r\nwere flogged. The plot had been revealed by a slave (presumably not a\r\nHausa}, and the arrests brought discovery of two arms caches. The\r\nrebels had sought to rise up on 29 May during the Corpus Christi\r\nfestivities, when security would be lax.\r\n<br>&emsp;Here at the very outset of the insurrectionary cycle, some features\r\ncommon to many of the Bahian revolts were already apparent. Organization\r\nof the movement had apparently been along ethnic lines, in this\r\ncase Hausa. The plotters had sought to take advantage of the distractions\r\nof the colonial religious cycle. Corpus Christi, Holy Week, and\r\nChristmas came to be favored by those who sought freedom, and during\r\nChristmas slaveowners were particularly on guard. Noticeably,\r\nhere in the very first instance, the insurgents had planned to coordinate\r\na rising in the city with a rebellion in the Reconcavo. The mass of\r\nrural slaves held the key to success - and both slaves and masters realized\r\nthis. Salvador provided a milieu for conspiracy, a place where\r\ninteraction and communication between slaves was possible and might\r\npass unnoticed, a locale where freedmen or freedwomen of a particular\r\nethnic group might be enlisted to help. But the key to ultimate success\r\nlay in the mass of slaves at the engenhos and farms of the countryside. The slaves' victory over slavery had to be won in the\r\nReconcavo if it was to be won at all.\r\n<span class="entry_source">SUGAR PLANTATIONS IN THE FORMATION OF BRAZILIAN SOCIETY, Bahia, 1550-1835 STUART B .

1	A Model	1964	1964	bol1	power	Friendly Dictators by Dennis Bernstein and Laura Sydell	<p class="entry columns">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/fbanzer.jpg" style="float:right;padding:0px 10px;width:33%;">\r\nIn 1964, the New York Times wrote of Bolivia: &quot;No country in the Western Hemisphere is more dependent on Washington's aid and nowhere has the United States Embassy played a more obtrusive role in establishing that fact.&quot; So in 1970, when President Juan Jose Torres nationalized Gulf Oil properties and tin mines owned by U.S. interests, and tried to establish friendly relations with Cuba and the Soviet Union he was playing with fire. The coup to overthrow Torres, led by U.S. trained officer and Gulf Oil beneficiary Hugo Banzer, had direct support from Washington. When Banzer's forces had a breakdown in radio communications, U.S. Air Force Major Robert Lundin placed the U.S. Air Force radio at their disposal. Once in power, Banzer began a reign of terror. Schools were shut down as hotbeds of &quot;political subversive agitation provoked by anarchists opposed to the new institutional order,&quot; the Soviet Embassy was closed, and Banzer raised a foreign loan to pay Gulf Oil compensation. Within two years, 2,000 people were arrested and tortured without trial. \r\n<br>\r\nAs in Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil, the native Indians were forced off their land and deprived of tribal identity. Tens of thousands of white South Africans were enticed to immigrate with promises of the land stolen from the Indians. Migration Under Secretary Guido Strauss told the U.N. the goal was to create a &quot;white Bolivia.&quot; When Catholic clergy tried to aid the Indians, the regime, with CIA help, launched terrorist attacks against them, and this &quot;Banzer Plan&quot; became a model for similar anti-Catholic actions throughout Latin America.\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his dictatorship, Banzer is elected president in 1997 and serves until 2001, resigning because of cancer.</p>\r\n<p><i>Illustration by Bill Sienkiewicz</i></p>	large	f
2	Our Man in Havana	1952	1959	cub1	power	Friendly Dictators by Dennis Bernstein and Laura Sydell	<p class="entry columns">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/fdbatista.jpg" style="float:left;padding: 0px 10px;width:33%;">\r\nCuban Army Sergeant Fulgencio Batista first seized power in a 1932 coup. He was FDR's handpicked dictator to counteract leftists who had overthrown strongman Gerardo Machado, &quot;the Butcher.&quot; Batista ruled for several years, then left for Miami, returning in 1952 just in time for another coup, against elected president Carlos Prio Socorras. His new regime was recognized in a flash by President Eisenhower. \r\n<br>\r\nUnder Batista, U.S. interests flourished and little was said about democracy. With the loyal support of Batista, Mafioso boss Meyer Lansky developed Havana into an international drug port. Cabinet offices were brought and sold and military officials made huge sums on smuggling and vice rackets. Havana became a fashionable hot spot where America's rich and famous clinked cocktails with mobsters.\r\n<br> As the gap between the rich and poor grew wider, the poor grew impatient. In 1953, Fidel Castro led an armed group of rebels in a failed uprising on the Moncada army barracks. Fidel temporarily fled the country and Batista struck back with a vengeance. Freedom of speech was curtailed and &quot;subversive&quot; teachers, lawyers and public officials were fired from their jobs. Death squads tortured and killed thousands of &quot;communists.&quot; Batista was assisted in his crackdown by Lansky and other members of organized crime who believed Castro would jeopardize their gambling and drug trade. Despite this, Batista remained a friend to Eisenhower and the U.S. until he was finally overthrown by Castro in 1959.</p>\r\n<p><i>Illustration by Bill Sienkiewicz</i></p>	large	f
4	The Floating Gardens	1491	1491	mex1	ind	Open veins of latin america, galeano	<p class="entry" style="background:white; width:300px; padding:20px;">The Aztec confederation had achieved a high level of efficiency in the Valley of Mexico... ....The Aztecs' irrigation works and artificial islands dazzled Cortes —even though they were not made of gold. The Aztecs also responded in a remarkable way to nature's challenges. The surviving islands in the dried-up lake where Mexico City now rises on native ruins are known to tourists today as &quot;floating gardens.&quot; The Aztecs created these because of the shortage of land in the place chosen for establishing Tenochtitlan. They moved large quantities of mud from the banks and shored up the new mud-islands between narrow walls of reeds until tree roots gave them firmness. Between these exceptionally fertile islands flowed the canals, and on them arose the great Aztec capital, with its broad avenues, its austerely beautiful palaces, and its stepped pyramids: rising magically out of the lake, it was condemned to disappear under the assaults of foreign conquest. Mexico took four centuries to regain the population of those times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<i>Pictured is Diego Rivera's mural in Mexico City's Palacio Nacional showing the city of Tenochtitlan\r\n in Aztec times.</i>\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f
5	Maya	1491	1491	gua2	ind	The Penguin History of Latin America, Edwin Williamson	<p class="entry columns" style="color:white;padding:0px 10px;">\r\nThe other great civilization of Middle America, and the most highly\r\ndeveloped in the arts and sciences, was that of the Mayas, whose territory\r\nencompassed the Yucatan peninsula, southern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize\r\nand parts of Honduras and El Salvador. Its Classic manifestation occurred\r\nbetween ad 300 and 900 in the Peten jungle of northern Guatemala, though\r\nit is believed that Maya culture may have originated in around 1000 bc on\r\nthe coast of the Gulf of Mexico in the area near Veracruz, which also saw\r\nthe rise of Olmec culture. If so, Maya culture would have been remotely\r\ncognate with the Aztec.\r\n<br>\r\nClassic Maya society fell victim to the mysterious decline that first afflicted\r\nTeotihuacan. By the middle of the eighth century the Classic sites in the\r\nPeten had been abandoned. In about 900AD a Post-Classic Maya culture\r\nemerged at the northern tip of the Yucatan peninsula; this was the result of\r\na fusion with elements of central Mexican culture brought to the Yucatan\r\nby Toltec invaders, who conquered Yucatan and made their capital at\r\nChichen Itza, introducing new styles of architecture and art. The power of\r\nChichen Itza had declined by the thirteenth century and it was succeeded by\r\na new empire, whose centre was at Mayapan, but this too had disintegrated\r\ninto smaller states by the time the Spaniards arrived.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThe economy of the Mayas was based on maize, which was cultivated by\r\nslash-and-burn methods that exhausted the soil within a short period. A\r\nconsequence of this form of agriculture was a tendency for peasants to live\r\nin makeshift settlements of pole and thatch rather than in villages. Maya\r\ncities were therefore less concentrated than those in central Mexico, and were\r\nprimarily religious and administrative centres, where the priesthood and the\r\nnobility lived, though it appears that there was more residential settlement\r\nby the common people than was previously thought, especially in the main\r\ncities of northern Yucatan like Chichen Itza and Mayapan.\r\n<br>\r\nMaya kingdoms were ruled by a leader with religious as well as political\r\nauthority; society was divided into a class of commoners on the one hand\r\nand an upper class of priests, \r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/mayansculpture.jpg" style="float: right; width:100%; margin:0px 9px 0px 0px; ">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwarriors and administrators on the other.\r\n'Empires' were created when a kingdom was able to exact tribute and labour\r\nfrom other smaller states. Like the Aztecs, the Mayas believed that a succession\r\nof worlds had been created and destroyed, and that the present era would\r\nalso have an apocalyptic ending. To put off this calamity they sacrificed\r\nhuman beings and practiced various forms of expiation. Their concern with\r\nthe fate of the cosmos produced a complex calendrical system and a well-\r\ndeveloped mathematics, which discovered the concept of zero several centuries before any other people in history. Hieroglyphic writing appears on stelae, on temple walls and doorways, and in a number of codices; otherwise\r\nMaya culture was oral and rich in mythology, of which something has been\r\npreserved in the Popol Vuh, the sacred book of the Quiche Maya of\r\nGuatemala, which was written in the European alphabet from oral sources\r\nafter the Spanish Conquest. In architecture the Mayas surpassed other Amer-Indian civilizations; they were highly skilled in stone sculpture and mural painting, as is evidenced by the frescoes at Bonampak in Chiapas.\r\n</p>	large	f
7	The Treaty of Tordesillas	1494	1494	eur1	power	Open Veins of Latin America & The Cambridge History of Latin America, Vol 1	<img src="/mapimages/tordesillasblink.gif" style="position:absolute;right:0px;top:0px;">\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="width:460px;">\r\n<i>The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494, allowed Portugal to occupy Latin America territories below a dividing line traced by the Pope.</i>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Catholic Kings turned to the papacy, following the precedent set by the Portuguese, who had secured a formal papal donation of rights of sovereignty 'from Cape Bojador towards Guinea and beyond'. From a compliant Spanish pope, Alexander VI, they obtained what they wanted: similar rights in 'all islands and mainlands whatever, found or to be found' in the area beyond a national line of demarcation that was to be formally agreed between the crowns of Portugal and Spain in the treaty of Tordesillas of 1494. Alexander VI's bulls of 1493 might have been regarded as unnecessary in view of the Roman Law principle laid down in the Siete Partidas that possession belonged to the first occupiers of the land. But papal authorization gave an extra degree of security to Castilian claims against any attempted challenge by the Portuguese, and raised the enterprise of the Indies to the level of a holy undertaking by linking Castile's exclusive rights to an equally exclusive obligation to win the heathen to the Faith. This missionary enterprise, solemnly entrusted to the crown of Castile, provided it with a moral justification for conquest and colonization which at once reinforced and transcended claims deriving in one form or another from the fact of first discovery. The crown, having moved to ensure its primacy in the international arena, also moved to ensure its primacy in Columbus's enterprise. The fitting out of the fleet for his return voyage to Hispaniola - a fleet, this time, of seventeen instead of only three ships.\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f
8	Requerimiento	1495	1495	hai1	church	Open Veins of Latin America	<p class="entry " style="background-color:white;padding:15px;">A handful of cavalry, 200 foot soldiers, and a few specially trained dogs decimated the Indians. More than 500, shipped to Spain, were sold as slaves in Seville and died miserably. Some theologians protested and the enslavement of Indians was formally banned at the beginning of the sixteenth century. Actually it was not banned but blessed: before each military action the captains of the conquest were required to read to the Indians, without an interpreter but before a notary public, a long and rhetorical Requerimiento exhorting them to adopt the holy Catholic faith:\r\n&quot;<i>If you do not, or if you maliciously delay in so doing, I certify that with God's help I will advance powerfully against you and make war on you wherever and however I am able, and will subject you to the yoke and obedience of the Church and of their majesties and take your women and children to be slaves, and as such I will sell and dispose of them as their majesties may order, and I will take your possessions and do you all the harm and damage that I can.</i>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n<span class="bigquote" style="font-size:120%">Other <i>Requerimiento</i> Excerpts</span>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Why it was called that:</strong><br>\r\n<span style="margin-left: 20px;">\r\n"I <i>require</i> that you understand carefully this proclamation, take\r\nit utterly seriously, and deliberate about it for an appropriate\r\namount of time.

In one, he creates a rumor of gold to divide the Spaniards leaving them open to ambushes. At his defeat, he refuses to be enslaved. Different versions of events claim he is killed in a battle at his home, or that he is captured and taken to Spain in chains.\r\n<br><br />\r\nToday, Urracá's face is found on the one centesimo or &quot;centavo&quot; coin.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px; clear: both;">\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 12px;">The attention of Pedrarias was directed to</span> the west and north of Panama, rather than to the east and south. In the sierra of Veragua, on the south coast, dwelt a powerful cacique named Urracá. He was reported to have much gold; so Espinosa by sea, and Pizarro by land started out after the mountain chieftain. Urracá sent his women, children, and infirm to a place of safety and fiercely attacked the Spaniards with his fighting men. The licentiate was getting the worst of it, when Hernando de Soto came up with thirty of Pizarro's men and saved the Spaniards. When the latter retreated, the Indians fell upon them in the defiles of the mountains, and it was only by the most desperate efforts that the white men got back to the ships.\r\n<br> \r\n&quot;Espinosa wished to found a colony at Nata, the most attractive place yet visited on the Isthmus. He left at Nata fifty men under Companon, and returned to Panama. Urracá threatens Companon by night and kills one of his men, but is scared off by a single Spanish soldier. Runners are despatched for aid, and Hernando Ponce de Leon and the governor himself appear with reinforcements. They go out after Urracá and fight for five days, but are forced to come back to Nata, leaving the cacique unbeaten. Pedrarias divides the lands and captive Indians among such of his soldiers as elect to settle at Nata and sixty choose to remain and start a pueblo. Diego de Albites is left as the governor's lieutenant, and finally makes peace with Urracá; which displeases Pedrarias who appoints Francisco Companon to govern Nata.\r\n<br>\r\n&quot;Chiriqui was the name of a province west of Veragua, and Benito Hurtado was sent there to found a settlement. The country was thinly populated, and the two principal chiefs, Vareclas and Burica, submitted without resistance. For two years the colony remained unmolested; but the Spaniards became unbearable, and the Indians rose in revolt. Urracá again took up arms, but was induced to visit Nata under solemn assurance of safety. When in their power, the Spaniards put the chief in irons and sent him to Nombre de Dios, with the intention of shipping him to Spain. Luckily, the brave cacique burst his bonds and returned to his home to wage a relentless warfare against the white invaders.

The Indians received them as if they were their friends and relatives showing every mark of respect and affection, supplying them every day with food, the best that could be got. It is the generous custom of all the Indians in the New World to give liberally to meet the needs of the Spaniards from whatever they may have.<br>\r\nThese men began to make a large house of wood in which they could all live as this was what they had alleged they had come to do. When the time came to apply palm leaves to the supports and some way up the walls had been covered so that those without could not see within, the Spaniards said that they wanted to finish the house quickly and so put many Indians inside to help while the Spaniards went outside and drew their swords to prevent any Indians leaving. Then they began to threaten the defenseless Indians with death should they attempt to escape.They bound the Indians as prisoners while some, forcing their way out, were cut to pieces by the Spaniards.<br>\r\n Some who had managed to escape though wounded, and others from the pueblo who had not entered the house, seized their bows and arrows and retired to another building in the pueblo to defend themselves.\r\n<td>\r\n\r\n<td  width="700px"  valign="top" style="padding-top:370px;">\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\n When one or two hundred of the Indians were inside holding the gate, the Spaniards set fire to the house and burnt them all alive. With the prisoners who amounted to about 180-200 men whom they had been able to catch, they returned to their ship and set sail for the Island of San Juan (Puerto Rico) where they sold half of them for slaves; thence they went to Hispaniola where they sold the remaining half of the Indians. \r\n<br>\r\nHaving reprimanded the Captain for this dastardly treachery and evil attack when I met him at this time in the said Island of San Juan, he replied: &quot;I did, Sir, what I was ordered; those who sent me instructed me to take them how I could either by war or in peace.&quot; He also told me that in all his life he had never found Indians so kind and ready with assistance as those in the Island of Trinidad. I repeat this to emphasize the importance of his confession and to show how great was his sin.\r\n<br>\r\n Such things have often been done on the mainland repeatedly, the Indians being taken and enslaved without restriction. Should such things be allowed to continue and should Indians taken in this way be sold as slaves?"\r\n</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<p style="font-style:italic; position:relative;left:660px;font-size:smaller;">\r\nPictured, a detail of Johann Georg Kohl's reproduction of Diego Ribeiro's <br>\r\n1529 map of the eastern coast of the New World (red detailing added)</p>	large	f

The friars taught Enriquillo to read and write Castilian and to act &quot;civilized.&quot; His achievements did not prevent him from being assigned as a laborer to a Spaniard named Francisco de Valenzuela of San Juan de la Maguana in 1514, during the last great division of Hispaniola's Indians, and then passed on to Francisco's son and heir, Andres. \r\n<br>\r\nEnriquillo cooperated with the Spaniards, ordering his people to mine gold and grow food for them, until 1519 when Andres seized not only enriquillo's prized mare but also his wife, Mencia, to whom he had been married to in a sanctified Catholic ceremony. \r\nEnriquillo went to the town's leading Spaniard, Pedro de Vadillo, to demand justice, but Vadillo reprimanded him for speaking out against Andres. Furious, Enriwuillo consulted the church fathers in the capital, and they approached the royal Audencia (government council) with Enriquillo's demands for justice. Although the Spanish officials in the capital sympathized with the cacique and order Mencia's release, Enriquillo was forced to take their letter back to Vadillo, who threatened to jail him or put him in the stocks if her pursued the issue. Enriquillo gathered up Mencia and the rest of his people and led them to the desolate lands called Bahoruco, and from there he staged successful raids against the Spaniards for the next 13 years. As his fame spread, rebellios Indians and African slaves joined him. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span class="caption" style="float:right;max-width:50%">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/tainoscaciqueenriquillo.jpg" style="max-width:100%; padding:7px;"><br>\r\nThe statue of Enriquillo</span>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the years, numerous heavily armed bands of Spaniards were sent to dislodge Enriquillo, but they had no success until the 1533 expedition of Captain Francisco de Barrioneuvo, who bore promises of a pardon and liberty from King Charles V—and who took along the Dominican friar Bartolome de Las Casas to convince the Cacique of the inscereity of the offer. (Las Casas described Enriquillo as &quot;grave and strict,&quot; neither handsome nor ugly, tall, with a well-proportioned body.) Enriquillo reconciled with the king and agreed, henceforth, to return runaway slaves to Spanish officials. Later, a group of escaped slaves attacked the town of Azua, where Enriquillo was buried in 1535, to retaliate for his actions against black slaves. \r\n<br>\r\nBohoruco remained a refuge for rebellious cimarones (&quot;runaway slaves&quot;) until the late-nineteenth century. Today, there is a monumental sculpture dedicated to Enriquillo on the main road to Bahoruco, and the large salt lake in the region is known as Lago Enriquillo. The region is still considered unruly, for it is a center of voodoo.\r\n</p>	large	f

868	Llido	1974	1974	chi3	church	memoriayjusticia.cl	<div class="page" data-title="1"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/chilellido1974.jpg" class="floatright">\r\nAntonio Llido Mengual was born April 29, 1936 in Valencia, Spain. When the Republican government transferred from Madrid \r\nto Valencia, Valencia came under severe attack by Franco,  forcing the fall of the democratic government. Llido grew up and was ordained a priest in 1963 under the authoritarian  regime of Franco that killed 23 priests in the Basque country  alone. His working class family instilled democratic values in him, and his social commitment was already evident as a young parish priest in the villages of Balones and Quatretondeta, a poor community sustained by subsistence agriculture. \r\n<br>Fr.  Antonio Llido arrived in Chile in 1969, sent by the Episcopal Commission for Missions and Cooperation between Churches. \r\nHis work as a priest was conducted in Quillota, Valparaiso  Diocese, and a poor farm working community much like the villages \r\nhe left behind in Spain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFr. Jesus Rodriguez arrived in Chile in 1965 also from Spain, and was parish priest in the poblacion of La Victoria from \r\n1993, recalled:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n"From the moment he arrived in Chile, the poverty, misery, and the anguish of the poor the deeply affected him. Such was the situation he observed throughout the Valparaiso area. He lived very modestly, eating what the poor ate, living from his earnings as a French teacher. During the harvest season, He joined the humble farm workers working with them, and worked as an unskilled laborer." <br>\r\n<br>\r\n"Chile was highly politicized in those years. Working classes had a great yearning for justice. And with reason, because many social abuses existed. Antonio Llido's life was closely tied to groups of the poorest workers. Within that world of working people, various political groups advocated changes for a new society. He associated with many of them and had good relations with these groups that had such a strong yearning for justice."\r\n<br>\r\nThe  abysmal conditions of Quillota farm workers deeply affected  the new Spanish priest, forming a base for a strong social \r\nand political commitment. Antonio Llido belonged to "The 80,"  a group of Chilean and foreign priests, who participated in \r\nthe organization Cristianos por el Socialismo, that supported  presidential candidacy of Salvador Allende.\r\n<br>\r\nIn a letter he wrote to a friend on March 9, 1971, Llido described \r\nhis vocation: <br>\r\n"Faith  in a distant, ephemeral God, solver of problems by house call,  has also been left behind. Increasingly I come to understand  my religion and priesthood as a commitment to the society in which I live. A commitment to men and women who struggle for a new social order where slavery has no place, that prepares people to fully realize themselves, in which injustice and \r\nexploitation cease to be our daily bread. I understand Jesus Christ as very related to this matter. I understand Jesus \r\nChrist as each one of my brothers and sisters. I understand that in uniting with them in this struggle, perhaps I will \r\nbe capable of overcoming the small and large personal needs that are only relevant because they impede me from fully giving \r\nmyself to this task."\r\n<br>\r\nThe  Arrest and Search for the Missing Priest\r\n<br>\r\nFather Rodriguez again takes up the story:\r\n<br>\r\n"After the military coup, he was advised to return to his native land. He responded that he would not leave. In the hour of such hardship, he would not abandon the modest people with whom he had lived. He wished to share their lot. Still, shortly after the coup he was forced to leave the area because the military were looking for him, to kill him just as they looked for so many people. All of \r\nus who lived in Chile in those years bear witness of that fact. He went to Santiago, where he continued helping people \r\nwho were fleeing. He fled with those who were fleeing. Even though he himself was in danger, he continued helping others \r\nwho were persecuted. Once more, he was counseled to leave Chile, and once more he chose to stay and run the same fate \r\nshared by the poor and persecuted." <br>\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="2"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/chilellido1974.jpg" class="floatright">\r\nAfter the military coup, the military regime's security forces looked for him in Quillota, forcing him to leave the area. Llido \r\nwas hidden first in Valparaiso, and then in Santiago, where \r\nhe was arrested.\r\n<br>\r\nThe  last letter his family received, dated September 1974 and signed with the alias "Teresa Vazquez," indicated that Llido was aware of the risks he faced:\r\n<br>\r\nI do not wish to be melodramatic, but at some point I have to say it. If something bad should happen to me, I want you to know that my commitment to what I am doing has been freely contracted, with the joy of knowing that this is precisely what I should be doing at this moment. Fear is constantly present in each one of us, because none of us are movie heroes. But we refuse to accept that fear must condition our actions and prevent us from doing what with a cool head and fervent heart we understand should be done." \r\n<br>On October 1, 1974 Antonio Llido was arrested in downtown Santiago. \r\n<br>\r\nFather Jesus Rodriguez attempted to intervene for many people after the coup. He was also very concerned about the situation of \r\nAntonio Llido. Accompanied by another Catalan priest, several times he visited Valparaiso Bishop Emilio Tagle who had good \r\nrelations with the military.<br>\r\n"In March 1975, I remember he told us: "I have just spoken to a Minister of State who says Llido is under arrest but he is well." We visited him again during the month  of May, and once more he told us, "I have spoken to a very  high official. He tells me that this situation will be resolved well." We doubted everything he told us, but never did we tell him, 'You are very naive.' In June we visited him again, and this time, he was indeed disturbed. He got up, nervously pacing his office, and said, 'Now, I can't understand it. An important Minister of State has just told me that this young priest was being transferred to another place of detention, and en route, he escaped.' He was very nervous. On our previous visits, he thought what they were telling him was true. But this time, he could not believe it." \r\n<br>\r\nMartyrdom \r\n<br>\r\nThe terrible truth that the anonymous high official of State concealed from Bishop Tagle was that DINA agents had taken Antonio Llido to the interrogation and torture center at 1315 Jose Domingo Ca&ntilde;as Street in Santiago, known as Ollague Barracks. \r\nDuring the second week of October, he was transferred to cell 13 at Cuatro Alamos, a detention center where prisoners were \r\nheld incommunicado. He remained there until October 24, when he and other prisoners were taken to an unknown location. \r\nSince that day, the Spanish priest Antonio Llido became one of hundreds of persons forcibly disappeared in Chile. \r\n<br>\r\nNumerous witnesses, who like Llido, were prisoners at Jose Domingo Ca&ntilde;as have testified in court that the priest was severely tortured. We highlight the testimonies of Julio Laks Feller and his wife Rosalia Martinez Cereceda, who shared a prison cell with \r\nAntonio Llido.\r\n<br>\r\nTestimony of Julio Laks Feller and Rosalia Martinez Cereceda \r\n<br>\r\nJulio Laks testified before the Spanish consulate on November 27, 1977. [ Laks recognized that &quot;the conditions of detention made it difficult to measure the lapse of time,&quot; accounting for the discrepancy in dates.] His testimony forms part of the \r\ncriminal complaint, as cited below: <br>\r\n                  <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="1">"Between September \r\n26 and 30 of the same year [1974] Fr. Antonio Llido Mengual \r\nwas placed in our cell. Over the course of two or three days, \r\nFr. Llido was taken from the cell many times for interrogation. \r\nEach time he returned in worse physical condition. After three \r\ndays he moved with great difficulty due to the pain inflicted \r\nin torture. His shirt was stained in blood and he apparently \r\nhad internal hemorrhages and torn muscles. On one occasion \r\na doctor who worked for the DINA examined his vital signs \r\nand recommended immediate hospitalization. In response to \r\nthe doctor's urgent recommendation, the official whose last \r\nname was Morel [Marcelo Moren Brito] responded that this was \r\nimpossible, as the interrogations had not finished. The doctor \r\ninsisted in vain, expressing his sense of powerlessness and \r\nindignation." <br>\r\n<br>\r\n"Despite his physical state and the abuse inflicted by DINA \r\nagents, who grossly mocked his condition as priest, he found \r\nstrength to console his cellmates, sharing his crusts of bread \r\nor fruit peels to help us survive." </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Concerning her detention with Antonio Llido, Rosalia Martinez \r\nCereceda stated in her own sworn testimony of December 19, \r\n1999:</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font size="1">"There I also met the Spanish priest Antonio \r\nLlido. He was accused of having hidden and protected people \r\nof the MIR who were persecuted. Antonio Llido never denied \r\nthis, saying that he could not lie to them. The guards would \r\nlaugh at him, and commented that when Antonio Llido was being \r\ntortured he was asked to name people, and he would say that \r\nhe could not give them the names. 'And why not?' the guards \r\nasked. 'Because of my principles,' Antonio replied in his \r\nSpanish accent, which the guards imitated." </font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the second week of October 1974, Julio Laks was transferred \r\nto Cuatro Alamos. A few days later, from the window of his \r\ncell, he saw Antonio Llido arrive and placed in the adjoining \r\ncell (number 13): "His state of health was somewhat better, \r\nbut he suffered great pain, as Icould note from his gestures." \r\nJulio Laks never saw him again. </font></p>\r\n                  <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>\r\n                  <p align="JUSTIFY"><b><i><font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="#top"><font color="ee3936">Return \r\nto top</font></a></font></i></b></p>\r\n                  <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>\r\n                  <hr>\r\n                  <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>\r\n                  <p ><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="003399"><b><a name="&quot;That one's"></a>&quot;That \r\none's not a priest; he's a Marxist .&quot;</b></font></p>\r\n                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> On November 13, 1974 General \r\nAugusto Pinochet granted a rare interview to an interfaith \r\ngroup of clergy, members of the Pro Paz Committee founded \r\nin the weeks following the coup to aid people in detention. \r\nMonsignor Fernando Ariztia, Lutheran Bishop Helmuth Frenz, \r\nthe Jesuit priest Fernando Salas and Rabbi Angel Kreiman had \r\nrequested the interview to express their concern for 11 persons \r\nwho had disappeared after detention. General Pinochet received \r\nthe ecumenical delegation in his office in the Diego Portales \r\nbuilding, and to the surprise of his visitors, he received \r\nthem alone, without the presence of any assistant.</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> \r\n</font></p>\r\n                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The clergy were especially concerned \r\nabout the situation of David Silberman, CODELCO director who \r\nhad been abducted from the Penitenciary in Santiago, and the \r\ncase of Fr. Antonio Llido who they knew had been arrested \r\nby the DINA and was held in the Jose Domingo Ca&ntilde;as \r\ndetention and torture center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelmut Frenz, today Pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church \r\nof Germany, testified on June 30, 2003 before Judge Jorge \r\nZepeda regarding the interview with Pinochet. Frenz recalled:<br>\r\n<font size="1">&quot;</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="1">I \r\nwondered how the General would justify or evade the crude \r\nproblem we would pose. That is, whether he would diminish \r\nit or simply deny that it was taking place</font></font><font size="1">. \r\nWe wanted the General to know that we knew what had happened \r\nto these people because we thought it would help the victims.&quot;</font></font> \r\n<br>\r\n<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>\r\nThey handed Pinochet a photograph of Llido and a list of people \r\nwhose whereabouts had been lost after arrest.Glancing in silence \r\nthrough the list, the General pointed to one name and told \r\nhis visitors:</font></p>\r\n                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> "That one is not a priest; he's \r\na Marxist.

Upon concluding our meeting, \r\nthe General told us something that I recall nearly word for \r\nword because it was so extraordinary. This is what he told \r\nus: 'As clergy you can give yourselves the luxury of being \r\nmerciful. But I am in charge of this country which is infected \r\nwith the bacteria of Communism.

The biggest of their battles to remain free broke out in 1541. The <i>Mixton War</i>, as it was labeled, set aflame the territory lying between Jalisco and Zacatecas. A few years before, Nuno de Guzman had inflicted his brand of civilization on it, killing and enslaving at will. His legacy of cruelty was kept alive by Spanish encomenderos. The war, which lasted two years, erupted on the edges of Zacatecas, where the Caxcanes, a sedentary farming people, blocked the northward Spanish march. Its leaders, native priests mostly, gave the war a profoundly religious, anti-Christian character. The Indians burned churches, destroyed monasteries, and cut down crosses. If they triumphed, so their banners proclaimed, they would extirpate all christian vestiges, restore the anciet religions, revive old customs, and rid the land of the spaniards. The defeat of the Indians in the Mixton War opened the way for the Spanish occupation of Zacatecas. The war brought death to Pedro de Alvarado, who, fleeing from the Indians, had a horse fall upon him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="background-color:white;width:384px;position:absolute;bottom:10px; left: 470px;font-style:italic;padding:7px;">A 1540 map of Nueva Galicia from shortly after the indigenous uprising.

28	Cerro Rico of Potosi 	1550	1699	bol1	economy	Open Veins of Latin America	<p class="entry columns">\r\n<img src="../mapimages/boliviapotosi2.gif" style="height:150px;padding:7px;float:left">\r\nIn the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the Cerro Rico of Potosi (Mexico's Guanajuato and Zacatecas silver mines had their boom much later) was the hub of Latin American colonial life: around it, in one way or another, revolved the Chilean economy, which sent it wheat, dried meat, hides, and wines; the cattle-raising and crafts of Cordoba and Tucuman in Argentina, which supplied it with draft animals and textiles; the mercury mines of Huancavelica; and the Arica region whence the silver was shipped to Lima, chief administrative center of the period. In the independence period the area, now a part of Bolivia, still had a larger population than what is now Argentina. A century and a half later Bolivia's population is almost six times smaller than Argentina's.\r\n<br>\r\nPotosian society, sick with ostentation and extravagance, left Bolivia with only a vague memory of its splendors, of the ruins of its churches and palaces, and of 8 million Indian corpses. Any one of the diamonds encrusted in a rich caballero's shield was worth more than what an Indian could earn in his whole life under the mitayo, (A mitayo is an Indian who pays a mita. or tribute, usually in the form of forced labor in public works, especially the mines) but the caballero took off with the diamonds. If it were not a futile exercise, Bolivia—now one of the world's most poverty-stricken countries—could boast of having nourished the wealth of the wealthiest. In our time Potosi is a poor city in a poor Bolivia: &quot;The city which has given most to the world and has the least,&quot; as an old Potosian lady, enveloped in a mile of alpaca shawl, told me when we talked on the Andalusian patio of her two-century-old house. Condemned to nostalgia, tortured by poverty and cold, Potosi remains an open wound of the colonial system in America: a still audible &quot;J'accuse.&quot; \r\n<br>\r\nIn three centuries Potosi's Cerro Rico consumed 8 million lives. The Indians, including women and children, were torn from their agricultural communities and driven to the Cerro. Of every ten who went up into the freezing wilderness, seven never returned. Luis Capoche, an owner of mines and mills, wrote that &quot;the roads were so covered with people that the whole kingdom seemed on the move.&quot; In their communities the Indians saw &quot;many afflicted women returning without husbands and with many orphaned children&quot; and they knew that &quot;a thousand deaths and disasters&quot; awaited them in the mines. The Spaniards scoured the countryside for hundreds of miles for labor. Many died on the way, before reaching Potosi, but it was the terrible work conditions in the mine that killed the most people. Soon after the mine began operating, in 1550, the Dominican monk Domingo de Santo Tomas told the Council of the Indies that Potosi was a &quot;mouth of hell&quot; which swallowed Indians by the thousands every year, and that rapacious mine owners treated them &quot;like stray animals.&quot; Later Fray Rodrigo de Loaysa said: &quot;These poor Indians are like sardines in the sea. Just as other fish pursue the sardines to seize and devour them, so everyone in these lands pursues the wretched Indians.&quot; Chiefs of Indian communities had to replace the constantly dying mitayos with new men between eighteen and fifty years old. The huge stone-walled corral where Indians were assigned to mine and mill owners is now used by workers as a football ground. The mitayos' jail—a shapeless mass of ruins—can still be seen at the entrance to Potosi.</p>	large	f
29	BAYANO!	1552	1557	pan1	redstar		<p class="entry shen" style="padding-left:300px;color:white;font-size:1.5em;position:relative;top:-78px;">King Bayano leads escaped slaves in the largest sixteenth-century revolt against Spanish colonial rule in Panama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;margin-left:270px;position:relative;top:-95px;">\r\nKing Bayano led the largest revolt against Spanish colonial rule in Panama in the sixteenth century. Bayano, a Mandinka and possibly muslim, was one of the four hundred Africans captured in West Africa for enslavement in Panama in 1552.  African slaves were needed because the Spanish has killed off most of the local tribes. The ship carrying the Africans sank, and the group escaped. Since they landed as free men they elected Bayano (who was reported to be a royal back home in his native Mandinka tribe in Africa) as their King and consequently fought the Spaniards to maintain their independence. This was the first rebellion against colonial authorities in Americas.\r\n<br>\r\nBayano was supported by the <i>Cimarrones</i>, the Spanish term for black runaway slaves who married Indians and resides in self-governing areas called <i>Palenques</i>. Bayano and his hundreds of Cimarrones lived at Ronconcholon, where his group grew stronger and fugitive community thrived. Since he could not abide by the horrific ill-treatment carried out by the Spanish, Bayano and his group fought the Spaniards in various ways for five years. He also gained support from the Scottish and the English pirates who enjoyed working with him to thwart the Spanish. Bayano frequently attacked mule train caravans that travel from Peru, across Panama, along Carmino Real (King's Highway), frequently procured gold and silver from the caravans, which seriously affected Spain's profit from its enterprises in the New World.\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spanish sent governor and conquistador Pedro de Ursua (1521 - 1561), who quickly realized that he was incapable of fighting the most experienced Cimarrones in their home terrain. De Ursua made a number of agreements to end the fighting, but in 1556, he deceitfully drew Bayano and his men into peace negotiation to discuss a truce, and the group came unarmed. De Ursua had 32 of Bayano's men poisoned, and only a few escaped as Bayano and his closest men were seized by the Spaniards.\r\n<br>\r\nIn a formal meeting with the Spanish viceroy, who lauded him for his tenacity, Bayano signed a peace treaty. His followers were allowed to retain their freedom. Bayano was freed, exiled to Peru, and then to Spain where he lived in a relative comfort due to the wealth he has amassed. A formal treaty that liberated the Cimarrones followed. Bayano died in Spain, but he remains an important historical figure in Panama where a dam, a valley, and a river bears his name. <span class="entry_source">Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion</span>\r\n</p>	large	f
18	The Slow Boil	1527	1527	pue1	redfist	Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion	<p class="entry columns3">\r\n&emsp;When the Spanish arrived in the Caribbean in 1492, they encountered\r\ntwo major groups of indigenous peoples. The Carib were found throughout the islands, but specifically populated the Lesser Antilles, while the Arawak chiefly inhabited the Greater Antilles. When these indigenous peoples were first encountered, the Spanish simply called them <i>Indios</i> or identified them according to the name of their respective chiefs, villages, or island location. The name <i>Taino</i>, which came into common use only in the early decades of the twentieth century and by which these tribal groups are generally known today was assigned to them by historians and anthropologists to refer to the entire indigenous population of the western Caribbean region. \r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;In 1498, in an attempt to placate discontented colonists on the island of Hispaniola, Christopher Columbus distributed to each them a parcel of land and the preexisting Indian communities on each. Spanish colonists could then force the Indians on their land to work without the compensation of wages in a state of serfdom or slavery, known in Spanish as <i>encomienda</i> or <i>repartimiento</i>. Juan Ponce de Leon, appointed by Governor Nicholas de Orvando, arrived at Puerto Rico and began to colonize the island in 1508. With a portion of the Spanish fleet and the authorization of the Crown, he began to exploit the island in the search for gold and captured native Taino to work as slaves on Hispaniola.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Three years later, the Taino of Puerto Rico revolted against the rule of the Spanish with little success. Ponce de leon ordered that six thousand be shot, but many fled the island. The following year, forty slaves owned by Diego Colon, the son of Christopher Columbus, resisted for several months before finally being caught and executed. The Dominican friars on Hispaniola, disheartened by the slow extermination of the Arawak, suggested that slaves, both white and black, should be imported to the islands. In 1512, in order to discourage Portuguese slave smuggling and in response to the writings of the Dominican friars, the Spanish government began to grant licenses to bring slaves directly from Africa to the Americas.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;In 1527, the first major slave rebellion occurred in Puerto Rico as dozens of slaves, likely of both African and indigenous origin, fought against the Spanish colonists in a brief and ultimately ill-fated revolt. The few slaves who escaped during this uprising retreated into the mountains where they resided as maroons with surviving Taino. Similar uprisings continued until the nineteenth century when slavery was finally abolished on Puerto Rico. As several areas of the island were only sparsely settled during these subsequent revolts, many slaves preferred flight into the countryside and life as maroons with the indigenous people rather than open revolt.</p>	large	t

15	Wolofs Lead the Hispaniola Revolt	1522	1526	domrep2	redfist	Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion, Volume 1  edited by Junius P. Rodriguez	<div class="page" data-title="The Wolof"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="width:550px;">\r\n<br>&emsp;In 1522, a momentous African uprising took place on the island of Hispaniola in what is today the Dominican Republic. Led by Wolof men from Senegal, it was the first recorded in a series of elaborate African revolts that shook colonial Spanish America. It paved the way for legislation that restricted the further introduction of Wolof and Muslims into the Spanish colonies. \r\n<br>&emsp;The Wolof presence in Hispaniola went back to the very first years of the arrival of Africans on the island in 1502. They had been the prisoners of several wars that took place in Senegambia in the early sixteenth century. The Jolof Empire , founded in the thirteenth century by a Muslim dynasty, had started to disintegrate with the transfer of power from the African interior, where societies had flourished through contact with the north via the trans-Saharan trade to the Atlantic coast following the arrival of the Portuguese and the establishment of trade relations with the newcomers. Each armed conflict that pined its vassal kingdoms against Jolof sent Wolof, Mandinka, Tukulor, and Fulani prisoners of war to Hispaniola, Mexico, Peru, and Colombia as slaves. People from the Senegambia region were the largest groups represented among the slaves introduced in early Spanish America, and many of them were Muslims.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe uprising started on December 25, 1522, four miles from Santo Domingo on the sugar plantation of Admiral Don Diego Colon, the viceroy of the Indies and Christopher Columbus's son. The date had been carefully chosen. Usually on that day the Spaniards\r\nwere drunk or tired from the festivities of the night before. The Wolof insurgents met with a group of about twenty men from other plantations and armed with the machetes they used to cut cane, they killed nine whites and burned fields. By December 28, they had reached the estate of Melchor de Castro, a large mine owner, killed another Spaniard, and captured a black man and twelve enslaved Indians. The insurgents had already killed twelve men when they came about a mile from Ocoa, sixteen miles from Santo Domingo, near the plantation of Zuazo. Their objective was to enter the estate, execute the Spaniards, and rally to their cause the 120 enslaved men and women who worked there.\r\n<br>&emsp;By then news of the revolt had spread, and the surprise effect was lost. Spanish settlers had rounded up all the soldiers, militia, and horsemen they could find. On December 29, they came in sight of the Africans near Zuazo's plantation. The horsemen charged them and killed a few, but the Africans did not panic as was expected; they opened their ranks, let the horses pass, and regrouped to face the countercharge. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Spanish Fear"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="width:550px;">\r\n\r\nWolof warriors were used to cavalry warfare. The king of Jolof had a company of eight to ten thousand mounted men according to the Portuguese who had visited the region between 1504 and 1506. Ironically. the Spaniards had asked for the forced introduction of the Wolof into their colonies because they needed men who were used to cattle raising and the handling of horses, and the slave ship captains found them in Senegambia.\r\n<br>&emsp;As the insurgents regrouped, they killed six Spaniards and wounded several, including Melchor de Castro, but the settlers were more numerous and better armed and they crushed the uprising. The surviving Africans took to the hills where they were pursued by a mixed force of Spaniards and Indians, and within a few days they were captured.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe insurgents had remained a small group, and the Spaniards were relieved, because few as they were, they still had managed to inflict casualties among the slaveholders and caused much damage to the plantations. Diego Colon acknowledged in a letter to the Spanish Crown that if the revolt had not been quelled quickly it would have claimed many Christian lives.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAlthough defeated, the rebellion had instilled tremendous fear in the Spanish colonists and they took measures to guard themselves from the people who were most involved in the uprising. On May 11, 1526, Spain passed the first measure in a series of anti-Muslim and anti-Wolof legislation. A royal decree forbade the introduction of "Gelofes," as they were often called, of Negroes from the Levant, of black people who had been raised with the Moors, and of people from Guinea. Six years later, another decree was issued that made reference to uprisings having resulted in the deaths of several Christians and stressed the danger still posed by the Wolof, who had also rebelled in San Juan , Puerto Rico, in Santa Maria, Colombia, and in Panama. The decree described them as "arrogant, disobedient, rebellious, and incorrigible." Despite the threat they represented, they continued to be introduced; and their tendency to revolt did not weaken. By the 1540s, Wolof maroons had formed their own cavalry with stolen horses, and they raided the plantations of Hispaniola. They went "always on horses" and proved to be "skilled and audacious, both in the charge and the use of the\r\nlance" as was mentioned in a letter sent on June 28, 1546, to the Spanish king.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n<font class="caption"><i>Pictured</i>, a Sengalese warrior from the 1780s</font>\r\n</p>\r\n	large	f

He was "an extraordinarily cunning Negro and very knowledgeable about things of war, whom all obey and all fear." Lemba, who was probably from the Kongo, appears to have become a <i>cimarron</i> (runaway) sometime in the the 1520s or early 1530s. He probably had been a slave on one of the island's many cane sugar ingenios, for this was the era when the first commercial cane sugar industry in the "New World" was on the rise, and Spaniards were clamoring to bring in more and more African slave laborers. "Lemba" was a kind of spiritual association of wealthy merchants&#8212;a mix perhaps of a church and the Rotary club&#8212;based in Kongo. Lemba's name hints thai he was a businessman caught in an Imbangala slave raid. If so, his organizational skills may have played a role in his leadership, which the Spaniards admitted was "extremely able.”\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nLemba and his men (up to four hundred were reported) were among the many African cimarrones who joined the rebellion of the\r\nTaino cacique Enriquillo from 1519 to 1534. Although Enriquillo finally negotiated a peace treaty with the Spanish crown for himself and his people, Lemba refused to accept the terms and refused to stop rebelling against the Spaniards.  Lemba and his men pillaged and attacked the Spaniards of Hispaniola and their allies, including Enriquillo's men, who had accepted the crown's terms.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nFar more vengeful than Enriquillo had been, Lemba broke his troops into small, mobile bands that pillaged sugar plantations and mills for sixteen years. So many slaves were inspired to revolt by his actions that the archdeacon of Santo Domingo claimed in 1541 that the number of guerrillas in the hills was greater than the number of Spaniards in Hispaniola. Only ten of Hispaniola's thirty-four\r\nsugar mills were open; the rest had been shut down by rebel slaves.  \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nFive years after the archdeacon's lament, Lemba was stabbed with a lance in September of 1547 by an African slave who was part of a Spanish patrol led by Captain Villalpando&#8212;that slave's reward was his liberty. Lemba's head was taken back to Santo Domingo and set upon a pike at the main gate leading to the wharves along me the Rio Ozama as a warning to others not to rebel. It did not work. The colonial government had utterly lost control. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nWithin months of Lemba's death its officials were complaining to the court that rebels were “killing and robbing Spaniards” just nine miles outside of Santo Domingo: there was a huge rebellion on an ingenio in La Vega (perhaps incited by some of Lemba's own men who had escaped the Spanish patrol), and other African slave captains such as Dieguillo de Ocampo and Juan Vaquero remained on the loose, causing havoc across the island. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nNot that this caused them to rethink their commitment to slavery: the same letter asked the king for permission to ship five to six thousand more slaves to open more sugar plantations.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe Spanish crown never managed to raze the whole community of insurgent Maroons.</p>	large	f

Vol 3.	<p class="entry columns" style="font-size:1.05em;"><i>In 1579, a native called Obera, who had been educated by a Catholic priest, led a movement within the context of Guarani resistance. He called himself the liberator of his people and incited his followers to subversive dances that would bring about the downfall of the Western system.</i>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Guarani labored with their Spanish kin as new iron tools improved productivity and Spanish power overawed enemies. After a few\r\nyears, however, the Guarani discovered that Spaniards no longer reciprocated, as aboriginal traditions required. The Guarani were considered not equal but inferior to Europeans. So the Guarani stopped working.\r\n<br>\r\nTheir resistance escalated into uncoordinated, abortive rebellions in 1539, 1542 or 1543, 1546, and several between 1556 and 1580. In 1546 Guarani males protested their loss of women to the Spaniards and revealed their dislike of infant mestizos, later the basis of ethnic Paraguayans. The mestizo preference for the world of their Spanish fathers was an unforgivable insult. The absence of children in Guarani villages had disrupted normal patterns. Insufficient children remained to work, support the kinship system, and carry on traditional life. "The uprising of Obera in the Guarambare region in 1579 . . . can be considered as a paradigm of the many Guarani liberation movements." Known mainly through the poem of Archdeacon Martin Barco de Centenera, who served on the punitive expedition to suppress Guayraca, heir to the legacy of resistance, Obera (also written as Overa) was a baptized Guarani. He had experienced the oppression of the encomienda, and he resisted. Pulling Christian doctrine into the framework of Guarani oratory, Obera became a leader of Guarani liberation. "He called himself a true son of God, born of a virgin, incarnated for the liberation of his people." He named his son Guyraro as his pope, but his movement failed.\r\n</p>	large	f
33	The Truth, The Liberty, The Greed	1581	1685	mex1	ind	Open Veins of Latin America	<p class="entry columns" style="font-size:1.05em;">\r\n<img src="../mapimages/philipiispain.png" style="float: left; margin:0px 9px 0px 0px; ">\r\n\r\n  \r\nIn 1581, Philip II,<font style="color:#cc0000;font-style:italic"> pictured</font>, told the <i>audiencia</i>* of Guadalajara that a third of Latin America's Indians had already been wiped out, and that those who survived were compelled to pay the tributes for the dead. The monarch added that Indians were bought and sold; that they slept in the open air; and that mothers killed their children to save them from the torture of the mines. Yet the Crown's hypocrisy had smaller limits than the empire: it received a fifth of the value of the metals extracted by its subjects in all of the Spanish New World, as well as other taxes, and the Portuguese Crown was to have the same arrangement in eighteenth-century Brazil. Latin American silver and gold—as Engels put it—penetrated like a corrosive acid through all the pores of Europe's moribund feudal society, and, for the benefit of nascent mercantilist capitalism, the mining entrepreneurs turned Indians and black slaves into a teeming &quot;external proletariat&quot; of the European economy. Greco-Roman slavery was revived in a different world; to the plight of the Indians of the exterminated Latin American civilizations was added the ghastly fate of the blacks seized from African villages to toil in Brazil and the Antilles. The colonial Latin American economy enjoyed the most highly concentrated labor fore known until that time, making possible the greatest concentration of wealth ever enjoyed by any civilization in world history.<br>\r\n  \r\nThe price of the tide of avarice, terror, and ferocity bearing down on these regions was Indian genocide: the best recent investigations credit pre-Columbian Mexico with a population between 30 and 37.5 million, and the Andean region is estimated to have possessed a similar number; Central America had between 10 and 13 million. The Indians of the Americas totaled no less than 70 million when the foreign conquerors appeared on the horizon; a century and a half later they had been reduced to 3.5 million. In 1685 only 4,000 Indian families remained of the more than 2 million that had once lived between Lima and Paita, according to the Marquis of Barinas. Archbishop Liñan y Cisneros denied that the Indians had been annihilated: &quot;<font style="color:#cc0000;font-style:italic">The truth is that they are hiding out</font>,&quot; he said, &quot;<font style="color:#cc0000;font-style:italic">to avoid paying tribute, abusing the liberty which they enjoy and which they never had under the Incas</font>.&quot;\r\n</p>\r\n<p style="width:460px;font-size:small;position:relative;left: 524px;top: -17px;">*An <i>audiencia</i> was a judicial district as well as a judicial, administrative, and advisory body.

Assaults by thousands of soldiers were fruitless against the guerrilla tactics which, until 1693, made the refuge invulnerable. The independent kingdom of Palmares&#8212;a call to rebellion, a banner of liberty&#8212;was organized as a state, similar to the many that existed in Africa in the seventeenth century. It extended from near Cape Santo Agostinho in Pernambuco to the northern Rio Sao Francisco zone in Alagoas, an area one-third the size of Portugal and surrounded by dense, wild forests. The ruling chief was elected from among the wisest and most skillful: the man, of greatest prestige and success in war or command. When the sugar plantation was at its height of omnipotence, Palmares was the one corner of Brazil where agriculture was being diversified. Guided by their own experience or that of their ancestors in African savannas and forests, the blacks raised corn, sweet potatoes, beans, manioc, bananas, and other foods. The colonial troops, assigned to bring back the men who had crossed the sea in chains and deserted the plantations, believed&#8212;and not without reason&#8212;that the destruction of these crops was their main purpose.\r\n<br>\r\nThe abundance of food in Palmares contrasted with its lack in coastal areas at the zenith of the sugar prosperity. The slaves who had won liberty defended it ably and bravely because they shared its fruits: land in the black state was held in common and no money circulated. No slave rebellion in world history lasted as long as that in Palmares: Spartacus's rebellion, which shook the most important slave system of ancient times, lasted eighteen months. For the final onslaught the Portuguese Crown mobilized the biggest army seen in Brazil until the colony became independent much later. No fewer than 10,000 people defended the last bastion of Palmares; the survivors were beheaded, thrown from precipices, or sold to merchants in Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires. Two years later the chief Zumbi, whom the slaves believed to be immortal, was betrayed and captured. He was surrounded in the forest and his head cut off. And rebellions continued. Not long afterward Captain Bartolomeu Bueno do Prado returned from the Rio das Mortes with trophies of victory over another slave rising. He brought 3,900 pairs of ears in his horses' saddlebags.\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f

It gave the United States a way to control Cuba without running it directly, by maintaining a submissive local regime. Washington would go on to apply this system, with clever variations attuned to local circumstances, in many parts of the Caribbean and Central America, where to this day it is known as <i>plattismo</i>.  Most of those semicolonial relationships remained operative for decades until the 1930s Good Neighbor policy modified or ended them. Most were used as well to legitimize periodic American interventions, often multiple ones such as the three in Cuba in 1906, 1912, and 1917, and often long-term ones such as the nineteen-year occupation of Haiti. Before 1917, some used an alleged German strategic threat as justification, but interventions continued apace after World War I simply substituting implicitly race-based rationales such as the paternalistic “Moral Uplift” program in Haiti.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Veto"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="font-size:1.05em;background-color:white;width:500px; padding:10px;">\r\n\r\nUnder the Platt Amendment as written by the U.S. Secretary of War, the United States agreed to end its occupation of Cuba as soon as the Cubans accepted a constitution with provisions giving the United States the right to veto any treaty between Cuba and any other country; the right to supervise the Cuban treasury; and "the right to intervene for the preservation of Cuban independence [or] the maintenance of a government adequate for the protection of life, property and individual liberty; the right to maintain military bases in Cuba (Under the last provision, the United States established its base at Guantánamo Bay, which it retains to this day over Cuban protests). Additionally, title IV ratified and validated “all acts of the United States in Cuba during its military occupancy.” The latter provision was quite important because while occupying Cuba, U.S. military authorities had given concessions to U.S. enterprises in various fields, particularly public utilities. Title IV ensured that none of those concessions would be altered or declared invalid by any future Cuban government. The Platt Amendment was not only insulting but also onerous to the people of Cuba, because under it they would have to pay not only for U.S. military expeditions, but also for occupations and their concomitant bureaucracy.\r\nIn essence, the Platt Amendment gave Cubans permission to rule themselves as long as they allowed the United States to veto any decision they made.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Reneging"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:1.05em;background-color:white;width:850px; padding:10px;">\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers of Congress could not avoid realizing that by passing the Platt Amendment, they would be reneging on the pledge they had made to Cuba less than three years before. Each had to ask himself a painful question that the <i>New York Evening Post</i> framed in a pithy editorial: "Given a solemn and unmistakable promise of independence to Cuba, how can I lie out of it and still go to church to thank God that I am not as other men are?" Senators resolved this dilemma without evident difficulty. On February 27, 1901, they approved the Platt Amendment by a vote of forty-three to twenty. Republicans cast all the affirmative votes. Later the House of Representatives joined in approval, also on a party-line vote. President McKinley signed the amendment into law on March 2. That plunged Cuba into what one historian called "a storm of excitement." \r\n<span class="blockquote" style="font-style:italic;">\r\nHavana was in turmoil on the night of March 2. A torchlight procession delivered a petition of protest to Wood at the Governor's Palace, and another crowd of demonstrators sought out the convention delegates and urged them to stand firm in their opposition to American demands. Similar demonstrations occurred on the following night. Outside the capital, municipal governments throughout the island poured out a flood of protest messages and resolutions, while public meetings were epidemic. \r\nOn the night of March 5, speakers told a procession in Santiago that if the United States held to its demands, the Cubans must go to war once more. </span>\r\n\r\nBoth Cuban anarchist papers <i>¡Tierra!</i> and <i>El Nuevo Ideal</i> published energetic protests against the Amendment. Cuban delegates to the constitutional convention had to decide whether to accept the Platt Amendment. American officials assured them that the United States wished no direct influence over Cuba's internal affairs, and also warned them that if they did not accept the Platt Amendment, Congress would impose even harsher terms. After long debate, much of it conducted behind closed doors, the Cuban delegates agreed, by a vote of fifteen to fourteen, to do what the United States wished. A year later, in an election the Americans supervised, Tomas Estrada Palma, who had lived for years in the town of Central Valley, New York, was chosen as the first president of the Republic of Cuba. General Wood, the military governor, wrote in a private letter what every sentient Cuban and American knew: <span style="color:#cc0000;">"There is, of course, little or no independence left Cuba under the Platt Amendment."</span>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Domination"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="font-size:1.05em;background-color:white;width:500px; padding:10px;">\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Navy established GTMO in eastern Cuba (Oriente), more than six hundred miles from Havana. Underdeveloped by the Spanish colonial regime and in close proximity to Jamaica and Haiti, eastern Cuba’s economy was quite limited at the turn of the century. After 1898, U.S. financial interests invested heavily in Oriente. For example, in 1902 Cuba’s eastern provinces produced only\r\n15 percent of the island’s sugar; by 1924 the proportion had increased to 54 percent, and by 1929 it was 69.5 percent. American-owned sugar companies, including the Cuban American Sugar Company, the UFC, and the Guantánamo Sugar Company, dominated Oriente’s economic landscape. United Fruit Company towns such as Banes and Preston existed largely\r\noutside Cuban law as quasi-independent enclaves within eastern Cuba.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThe situation essentially represented de facto if not fully de jure colonialism. For more than three decades, U.S. economic and political control of the island republic was quite open and was often reinforced by actual or threatened military intervention. Foreign domination, in combination with the native class system, produced a political system dominated by two almost indistinguishable political parties, the Conservatives and Liberals, who alternated in office under the leadership of their usually corrupt chieftains. Cuban politicians accommodated themselves to the internal and external status quo, and some had direct ties to U.S. business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>In 1934, the Platt Amendment was officially abolished, although United States retains in perpetuity a naval base in Guantánamo Bay.\r\n</p>	large	f

The US later &quot;negotiates&quot; a treaty with the newly formed Republic of Panama, thereby assuming control of the Panama Canal Zone.\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the United States obtained control over the unﬁnished canal works in Panama in 1903, through naval and diplomatic intimidation, it established army forts in the area.  Both the canal construction workforce and U.S. soldiers would live in Panama and have to grapple with tropical diseases that had overcome the French effort to dig a canal. The chosen method was through military control of potential vectors of malaria and yellow fever, thus reinforcing the rationale for and control exercised by the foreign military presence. The army was also entrusted with overseeing the construction and management of the canal itself from 1907 until the very end of the U.S. tenure in 1999.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="padding:10px;position:relative;top:-10px;">\r\nThe existence of a complex of military bases in the Panama Canal area, including extensive tropical lands, and the clientelistic relationship between the U.S. and Panamanian states made the isthmus a convenient place to locate activities to help project U.S. power throughout the hemisphere and the Paciﬁc. Bases in Panama and Puerto Rico \r\nprovided convenient platforms from which to launch interventions in Central American and Caribbean nations, which the United States did frequently from 1900 to 1933. Though limited in scale, especially by today’s standards, the military interventions were always sufficient to determine the outcome of local conflicts, usually so as to favor U.S. commercial interests.  During World War II, the United States maintained as many as 63,000 troops in Panama and forced through an agreement to establish more than 100 military bases outside the Canal Zone in the interior of Panama, ostensibly to defend the canal.<br>\r\nDuring the Cold War, United States military doctrine for Latin America and the Caribbean focused on increasing the capacity of national militaries for “internal defense,” i.e. combating forces within Latin American countries that challenged the existing order. The doctrine frequently did not distinguish between armed insurgency and peaceful agitation, or even civic opposition. Fort Gulick in Panama became host to a U.S. Army facility known as the School of the Americas, which trained 29,000 Latin American troops between 1949 and 1984, when the school was moved to Georgia. The air force and navy trained thousands of Latin American soldiers at other facilities in Panama. But the United States also trained and tested for its own military adventures, especially in Southeast Asia. The ﬁring ranges and sites in Panama provided the central location for testing weapons (missiles, nerve agents, depleted uranium) and other military equipment under tropical conditions. A jungle operations training center on Fort Sherman in Panama was a key location for training infantry bound for Vietnam.\r\n</p>	large	f

Mack 	<div class="page" data-title="Trujillo"></div>\r\n<p class="columns">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/piratesafehavens.gif" style="float:left;padding:10px;"><span class="caption">Pirate Safe Havens of the Western Caribbean, 17<sup>th</sup> Century</span>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>British establish the colony of Honduras, now known as Belize. Let's look at the neighborhood:</i>\r\n\r\nThe informal English settlements in Central America became important smuggling centers, especially in the eighteenth century. The Treaty of Madrid of 1670 recognized all lands then currently occupied by the English in North America and the West Indies as their possessions  and the English later claimed that the Treaty included the settlements in Belize and the Mosquito Coast, a claim the Spanish never recognized. The English had begun to trade with the Miskito Indians at Cabo de Gracias a Dios at least by 1633, beginning the English-Miskito alliance. As the Industrial Revolution began, the demand in Britain for indigo dye from Central America increased, especially after the general expansion of the world economy in the 1730s. The British settlement at Black River on the Mosquito Shore became a major center from which to conduct illegal trade with the Spanish during the 1700s. Several smaller British settlements on the Mosquito Shore also served as trading sites, but mostly with the Zambos Mosquitos, the loyal allies of the British, without whose protection and allegiance the trade would have been impossible to carry out.\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the eighteenth century, Trujillo was well situated for the increasing smuggling activity along the Caribbean coast. Founded in 1525, Trujillo served as a port to ship gold from the interior to Spain. The gold hinterland lasted until around 1550, by which time most of the easily removed gold had been mined and the indigenous labor had declined drastically. Sarsaparilla and cattle hides replaced gold as the major export items throughout the next eight decades, but even though large amounts were shipped out from Trujillo they failed to bring riches to the city. In the 1630s and 1640s, both Dutch and English pirates repeatedly attacked Trujillo, with Spain nearly powerless to stop such attacks. The city's decline began shortly afterwards, and the 1683 census reported the city as completely abandoned. The people of the town had moved inland to the Aguán Valley to escape pirate attacks and had established their own, unauthorized settlements, with many living in homesteads quite a distance from each other, much to the dismay of the province's officials. Although officially abandoned, Trujillo soon became a busy contraband entrepôt.\r\n<br>\r\nAs early as 1718, Spanish citizens met British traders at Trujillo, and contraband activity began increasing through the 1720s. By 1737, the anchorage called Puerto Nuevo or Puerto Escondido, at the end of the spit that forms the bay where the modem port of Puerto Castilla is located, was in regular use by British ships because of the refuge the site afforded from the rough, open seas. During this period, the frontier between the Spanish and the British/Zambos-Mosquitos ran through Trujillo Bay, the lower Aguán Valley, and the Agalta Valley, continuing with the general frontier between the Spanish settlements and indigenous settlements in western Olancho. At Trujillo, British goods were unloaded from ships and placed directly on mules that carried them to the interior.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="The Contraband"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/contrabandhinterland.gif" style="float:left;padding:10px;"><span class="caption">Contraband Hinterland of Trujillo, 1720s to 1780s</span>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people of Sonaguera supplied mules, horses, hides, and a large number of cattle for the contraband trade. Sarsaparilla was another major product for smuggling that came from the Aguán Valley, mostly from the lower and wetter sections. The residents of Sonaguera also sold food, including plantains and chickens, to passing ships that stopped in Trujillo Bay. Illegally imported goods found in the Aguán Valley included cloth, clothing, food, spices, and other miscellaneous products. Cattle from Yoro was traded at Trujillo for British clothing.\r\n<br>\r\nSpanish officials knew that the contraband trade with the Olancho Valley through Trujillo was enormous. Illegally obtained foreign goods were openly traded in Olancho el Viejo. Cattle from Olancho traveled by way of the road opened by the British to Trujillo. Silver was an important trade item from Olancho to the British, through Trujillo. In Juticalpa, investigators discovered eighteen cargas of textiles and clothing from England. The primary documents have few details on the types of items and the amounts that were smuggled, but all indicate that there was substantial illegal trade through the Olancho Valley connected through Trujillo. Indigo, silver, gold, sarsaparilla, and other goods came from Tegucigalpa, the major portion of the trade, and Mineral de los Cedros. From Comayagua came salt, cacao, necklaces, hammocks, tallow, lard, and deer hides. Illegal British good, plentiful in both Comayagua and Tegucigalpa, often were sold in the open. During Semana Santa in 1745, the wife of the governor of Honduras received a ring from a contrabandista who was trading openly in Comayagua.\r\n<br>\r\nThe contraband hinterland for Trujillo extended even to Nicaragua and El Salvador. Cacao and maize are specifically mentioned as products brought from the city of Leon to the port. Indigo, however, was the main trade item, coming largely from El Salvador. Mule trains carrying indigo were said to pass continuously and in public view from San Miguel along both the major routes to Trujillo. People from San Miguel traveled to Black River and traded indigo for British textiles. In Nicaragua and San Salvador British goods sold openly, often coming from Trujillo.\r\n</p>	large	f

La Picota, 1650. </span>\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;On May 2, 1612, thirty-five blacks were publicly hanged in the main plaza of Mexico City before a large crowd. The condemned, including seven women, had been sentenced to death for plotting an uprising of black slaves to overthrow the racial and political control of the Spanish in Mexico. The Audiencia (royal court of Mexico) ordered that twenty-nine of the bodies be decapitated, with the heads left atop the gallows, while the remaining six bodies were to be quartered and displayed throughout the city as a warning to blacks throughout Mexico&#8212;both slave and free&#8212;not to challenge Spanish power. Twelve days later another black man was executed, while Spanish authorities sent several others implicated in the plot to Spain to testify before the king. The bodies of the condemned rotted in the streets until physicians in the city warned that their stench and decomposition had created a public health hazard.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe few accounts of the Mexico City Plot of 1612 that survive come mainly from Spanish sources, making it uncertain whether a conspiracy did in fact take place. Most reports, however, asserted that a group of blacks in Mexico City, angry at their continued abuse at the hands of the Spanish, decided to overthrow and murder the white population of the city. Once in control, the rebels supposedly hoped to crown a black king and queen of Mexico, execute all male Spaniards, and take the remaining female Spaniards as their concubines. The original plan called for the uprising to commence during the 1611 Christmas celebrations, when most whites would be distracted by religious activities, but was postponed because of the arrival of several Spanish military units in the city on the eve of the revolt. Rescheduled for Holy Thursday during the celebration of Lent, when whites would again be distracted by religious duties, rumors of the uprising began to swirl around the city, and Spanish authorities received several warnings (usually from people claiming to have overheard the plotting) as the date approached. Acting swiftly, the Audiencia immediately cracked down on the black community in Mexico City, rounding up local leaders who, under torture, explicated the plan and implicated others. When several caches of arms surfaced, the Audiencia sentenced the conspirators to death.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe harsh reaction of Spanish officials came, in part, because of their earlier experiences with uprisings among Mexico's sizable black population. A near-revolt had been avoided in 1608 and a large demonstration of fifteen hundred blacks in Mexico City in 1611, sparked by outrage over the flogging death of a female slave, had the white population of the city on edge. While the executions of those implicated in the 1612 plot were certainly an effort to discourage future revolts among the slave and free black populations of Mexico, it was also an effort by the authorities to demonstrate to whites in Mexico that the Spanish crown could indeed protect them from such uprisings. Accordingly, Spanish officials immediately issued new restrictions on black Mexicans limiting their movement, outlawing black organizations, and banning the sale of weapons to blacks.\r\n</p>	large	f

Their rebellions against white invaders resounded with protests against the Church. During the uprising of 1598 the natives &quot;profaned&quot; more than fifty churches or chapels and renounced their christian names. Mapuche peasant materialism was a wall of contention raised against Catholic eschatology: the former owners of the land of Chile did not accept the doctrine of hell and imagined a heaven full of earthly delights.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n&emsp;The Mapuches (Araucanians) triumphed as no other indigenous peoples due to their political organization and war pacts\r\nmodeled on the Polynesian toki. The matrilineal but polygamous Mapuche clans in war time elected a\r\nleader from among its most valiant, strong, and intelligent individuals.\r\nLike the Roman dictatorship, this institution permitted concerted action\r\nin warfare. Afterward, the toki (military chief) returned to his earlier\r\nactivities, and the chiefs resumed governance of their clan. Thus, a military\r\ninstitution original to the Polynesians and wielded by the Mapuches impeded the Spaniards during the entire colonial epoch from ever conquering southern Chile.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;<a data-entry="24" data-year="1540" class="inline">Lautaro</a>, son of Curiñancu, and Caupolicán, who defeated the conquistadores, excelled among the\r\nMapuches, who impeded European and criollo occupation of southern\r\nChile until the nineteenth century.

Velasco was concerned that Mexico already had too many Africans&#8212;and he feared what they might do\r\nif they were organized. It turned out he had good reason. \r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nBetween 1570 and 1609, a slave named Gasper Yanga escaped and led a group of his fellow Africans to freedom in the mountains located in the vicinity of Pico de Orizaba (Citlaltepetl, or &quot;star mountain&quot;, the highest mountain in Mexico), the Cofre de Perote, Zongolica and Olmec regions. By 1600, it is reported that the Yanga maroon settlement, or palenques, was joined by Francisco de la Matosa and his group of African maroons. \r\n Not only did he escape slavery fifty years before the Mayflower landed on Plymouth Rock, but he launched guerrilla attacks on the Spanish, tormenting them from the mountains for three decades. The Spanish could never catch him, never put him back in bondage.\r\nAll of this occurred before the independence of Mexico from the Spanish crown. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nYanga's early palenques would turn into decades-long resistance against colonial Spain. In 1609, Spain's viceroy of New Spain (the colonial name of Mexico) was Luis de Velasco, Marquis of Salinas. That year, Velasco sent Captain Pedro Gonzalez on a military expedition against the Yanga palenques. The battle came to a head at the Rio Blanco and resulted in major losses on both sides. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nBy 1631, viceroy of New Spain Rodrigo Pacheco began negotiations with the Gaspar Yanga resistance. Yanga struck an agreement with the colonial leader respecting Spain's recognition of an autonomous region for the African community. The first official name was San Lorenzo de los Negros (aka San Lorenzo de Cerralvo), near Cordova. Since 1932, the Mexican town has bore the name of its liberator Gasper Yanga. \r\n\r\n</p>	large	f

Entering Atotonilco, the Indians killed ten missionaries and 200 civilians. That same night they surrounded to Santiago Papasquiaro, where the Christians resisted 17 days. The Tepehuanes Indians had limited success in trying to enlist the aid of the Conchos Indians who lived around the Parras mission, on the northern edge of the Tepehuan territory. On the other hand, they had considerable success in getting the Acaxees and Xiximes to attack Spanish mines and settlements in western Nueva Vizcaya. However, when the Tepehuanes advanced on the recently converted Acaxee pueblos of Tecucuoapa and Carantapa, the 130 Acaxee warriors decided to side with the Spaniards and decisively defeated their Tepehuan neighbors. Because the loyalties of the Acaxees and Xiximes were divided, the Spaniards were able to extinguish their uprising more rapidly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="entry" style="padding:0;margin:0;margin-top:10px;opacity:1;">\r\nNative allies of the Spaniards were crucial in mounting an effective defense against the Tepehuanes and in putting down the revolt. On December 19, Captain Gaspar de Alvear led a force of sixty-seven armed cavalry and 120 Concho allies into the war zone to confront the insurgents. The hostilities continued until 1620 and laid waste to a large area. When Mateo de Vesga became Governor of Nueva Vizcaya in 1618, he described the province as &quot;destroyed and devastated, almost depopulated of Spaniards.&quot; By the end of the revolt, at least a thousand allied Indians had died, while the Tepehuanes may have lost as many as 4,000 warriors. Professor Spicer regards the Tepehuan revolt as &quot;one of the three bloodiest and most destructive Indian attempts to throw off Spanish control in northwestern New Spain.&quot; Following the revolt, the Tepehuanes fled to mountain retreats to escape Spanish vengeance. Not until 1723 would the Jesuits return to work among them.</p>\r\n</div>	large	f

The runaways built a formidable camp upon the mountainside. It was protected by a precipice on one side and could only be approached by a narrow pass. From this position they carried out raids on the plantations.\r\n<br>\r\nTo put an end to their activities, Governor De Poincy raised a company of five hundred armed men. The stronghold was stormed by the soldiers and the uprising was crushed without much difficulty as the runaways were poorly armed and too few in number to offer much resistance. Most of them were killed in skirmishes. Some of the runaways were burnt alive, while the rest were captured, quartered, and their limbs exposed on stakes to serve as a warning to those who might be tempted to rebel. However, one of their leaders, a gigantic man, escaped and continued to elude capture for three years and was able to carry on a one-man reign of terror from the forests of Mount Misery. He served as a rallying point for other discontented enslaved Africans and was kept well \r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entry" style="background-color:white;padding:7px;position:absolute;top: 50px; right:20px;width: 290px;">\r\ninformed of what was going on in the settlements.\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he continued to live apart from his fellow runaways, fearing that one of them might betray him in order to gain favour with the planters. His success in evading capture inspired many to think that he was aided by supernatural powers. Realising the danger that this situation caused to the French settlement on the island, De Poincy sent some half a dozen soldiers to track him down and capture him. The mission was kept secret to prevent the slaves from giving him advance notice of what was to come. The soldiers pursued him and once they had him in their sights they blazed away at him. None of their muskets would go off and the infuriated African sword in hand, charged them. The men fled and he was able to gain a musket and a hat. Again the rumor spread that the runaway possessed magical powers that protected him from fire arms.\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly the French Governor sent out another squad to seize him. Again the African was found and surrounded, again shots were fired and again he was not hit. However, the sergeant who must have kept his nerve more than his subordinates, shot him through the head. His body was quartered and the limbs hung in the most public places.\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f

This point should be taken into account by those who, tied to the &quot;Let women keep silence in the churches,&quot; curse the idea that women should acquire knowledge and teach, as if it were not the Apostle himself who described them &quot;teaching well.&quot; Furthermore, that prohibition applied to the case related by Eusebius: to wit, that in the early Church, women were set to teaching each other Christian doctrine in the temples. The murmur of their voices caused confusion when the apostles were preaching, and that is why they were told to be silent.

An Irish Footnote</strong>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nBetween 1641 and 1653 Ireland suffered a demographic collapse of staggering proportions. Over a quarter of the population perished as a result of endemic warfare, famine and disease, including the last major outbreak of plague in the country. The architect of the English reconquest of the island, Oliver Cromwell, described Ireland as ‘a clean paper’, which, following the victory of the New Model Army, could be remodelled in the interests of the Westminster parliament. The Act of Settlement, passed in August 1652, outlined in detail the fate of the country and its inhabitants. The preamble reassured the general populace that the parliamentary regime did not intend ‘to extirpate the whole nation’, offering instead to extend mercy to ‘the inferior sort’, as long as they lived peacefully under the colonial government. The act contained a number of clauses, specifically excluding certain groups and named individuals from the general pardon. \r\n<br>\r\nPredictably, the first clause condemned those accused of killing Protestant settlers at the outbreak of the rebellion in 1641. The parliamentarians defined ‘involve-ment’ in the broadest possible sense to include not only those actively ‘bearing arms’ but also any person who assisted the rebels in any way. Technically, at least, this covered the vast bulk of the Catholic population. The second clause excluded all Catholic clergy from pardon, and hundreds were subsequently killed or banished overseas. The next clause listed over 100 named individuals, mostly prominent Catholic political and military leaders, some of whom had already departed for the Continent. All of them forfeited their extensive estates, and the colonial authorities in Dublin reserved the right to move any individual to another part of the country if deemed necessary for reasons of ‘public safety’. \r\n<br>\r\nDespite the potentially all-encompassing nature of the exclusion clauses, the Act of Settlement was primarily concerned with dispossessing Catholic landowners, thus enabling the parliamentary regime to repay its supporters, both soldiers and financiers, with confiscated land. During the remainder of the 1650s, the government transplanted over 40,000 people across the River Shannon into Connacht, where they could be effectively corralled and controlled. The common soldiers and ‘inferior sort’ provided a lucrative source of revenue for merchants with shipping at their disposal. As the war drew to a close, the parliamentarians, anxious to rid the country of hostile soldiers, licensed military entrepreneurs to transport large numbers into Spanish service. From 1652, articles of surrender invariably contained specific terms enabling Catholic commanders to depart for the Continent with their men. Between 1651 and 1654, as many as 40,000 Irishmen sailed for the Continent, often on English merchant ships. Many of these exiles dreamed of returning home, but few ever did. \r\n<br>\r\nWhile the government encouraged enemy soldiers to leave the country, a different fate awaited those civilians unsuitable for military service. In the early decades of the seventeenth century, England acquired a number of islands in the Caribbean, such as Barbados and Montserrat, and began to develop lucrative tobacco and sugar plantations. African slaves provided most of the field labour, but a demand also existed for indentured servants of European stock, who worked for a fixed period of time, ‘under a yoke harsher than that of the Turks’, before eventually obtaining their freedom. From the 1630s, official accounts record the arrival of the Irish in the Caribbean, many of them kidnapped by press-gangs operating in the vicinity of the principal ports in Munster. The journey across the Atlantic took almost three months, and those who survived the crossing found living and working conditions on the plantations extremely harsh. After seven years of service, a handful did acquire small landholdings, but none that we know of ever returned to Ireland. \r\n<br>\r\nThe outbreak of the rebellion in 1641 temporarily disrupted the Atlantic trade, but transportations resumed after Cromwell’s invasion in August 1649. The first shipment occurred towards the end of that year, when, after the storming of Drogheda, Oliver Cromwell ordered the few surviving members of the garrison to be sent to Barbados. Over the coming years, thousands of military prisoners were sold in perpetuity to plantation-owners to work in the fields, effectively as slaves. Despite the departure of so many soldiers to the Continent at the end of the war, small Tory bands continued to pose a serious, if localised, military threat throughout the 1650s. Local parliamentary commanders usually executed captured Tories, or else arranged for them to be shipped to the Caribbean, along with those civilians accused of assisting them.\r\n<br>\r\nThe war had also created a large number of widows and orphans, many of them destitute and homeless. Over the next ten years, unscrupulous merchants shipped thousands of these Catholic women and children across the Atlantic. The authorities in Dublin, concerned by the ‘great multitudes of poor swarming in all parts of this nation’, welcomed this trade as a means of clearing the country of vagrants. They also periodically emptied the jails by sending shiploads of convicts to the colonies, a practice that continued until the late nineteenth century, with Australia replacing the West Indies as the principal destination. In 1655, as part of the war against Spain, an English fleet captured Jamaica. Shortly afterwards, the government in Ireland arranged for over 2,000 Catholic boys and girls to be transported there in an attempt to repopulate the island. \r\n<br>\r\nThe Irish did not always meekly accept their fate. In 1655, runaway Irish and African slaves in Barbados began attacking local militia forces, killing plantation-owners and destroying crops. It took the authorities the best part of two years to suppress the disorder. The island continued to be plagued by vagrant Irish, encouraging slaves to rebel against their masters. Some of the more adventurous managed to escape from English-controlled territory to the French colonies, such as the Leeward or Windward Islands, while others joined the numerous pirate fleets that roamed freely throughout the Caribbean for much of the seventeenth century. The collapse of the Cromwellian regime and the restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660 brought an end to large-scale transportations. Most of the Irish indentured servants had been freed by 1680, although shipments of convicted Tories continued throughout the reign of Charles II. Their descendants continue to reside in the Caribbean, particularly on the island of Montserrat, where Irish surnames such as O’Connor, Fitzgerald and O’Carroll are still to be found today.  \r\n<br>\r\n<i>Micheál Ó Siochrú’s God’s executioner: Oliver Cromwell and the conquest of Ireland will be published shortly by Faber.</i>\r\n</p>	large	f

Indians who had lived and worshiped independently for centuries were forced to abandon their religions, adopt Christianity, and pay tribute to Spanish rulers. Their traditional centers of worship (kivas) were destroyed along with the sacramental objects (kachinas) with which their ceremonies and devotions had always been performed. Resistance to Spanish rule was met with imprisonment, torture, and amputations.\r\n<br>\r\n&#8195;&#8195;\r\nAfter three generations of oppression, in the spring of 1680, the Pueblo Indians rose up to overthrow the Spanish. A religious leader from Taos Pueblo named Pope (sometimes found as Popay) secretly organized a widespread rebellion to occur throughout the region on a single day. Planning took shape silently during the summer of 1680 in more than 70 communities, from Santa Fe and Taos in the Rio Grande valley to the Hopi pueblos nearly 300 miles west. On the night of August 10, 1680, Indians in more than two dozen pueblos simultaneously attacked the Spanish authorities. A force of 2,500 Indian warriors sacked and burned the colonial headquarters in Santa Fe. By the time the revolt succeeded, Indian fighters had killed more than 400 Spanish soldiers and civilians (including two-thirds of the Catholic priests in the region) and had driven the surviving Europeans back to El Paso.\r\n<br>\r\n&#8195;&#8195;\r\nThe Indian leaders then restored their own religious institutions and set up a government that lasted until 1692. The Pueblo Revolt of 1680 was the single most successful act of resistance by Native Americans against a European invader. It established Indian independence in the pueblos for more than a decade, and even after Spanish domination was re-imposed it forced the imperial authorities to observe religious tolerance. Ever since the seventeenth century, the cross and the kiva have existed side by side in pueblo communities.</p>	large	f

59	The African Slaves	1700	1711	afr1	economy	Open Veins of Latin America, Galeano	<p class="entry columns" style="column-fill:balance; height:540px;">The slaves spent their strength and their days in the gold-washing installations. &quot;There they work,&quot; wrote Luis Gomes Ferreira, a doctor who lived in Minas Gerais during the first half of the eighteenth century, &quot;there they eat, and often there they have to sleep; and since when they work they are bathed in sweat, with their feet always in the cold earth, on stones, or in water, when they rest or eat their pores close and they become so chilled that they are susceptible to many dangerous illnesses, such as very severe pleurisies, apoplectic and paralytic fits, convulsions, pneumonia, and many other diseases.&quot; The <i>capitaes do mato</i> of Minas Gerais collected rewards in gold for the severed heads of slaves who tried to escape. Disease was a blessing from heaven because it meant the approach of death.<br>\r\nThe slaves were called the &quot;coins of the Indies&quot; when they were measured, weighed and embarked in Luanda in the Portuguese colony of Angola; in Brazil those surviving the ocean voyage became &quot;the hands and feet&quot; of the white master. Angola exported Bantu slaves and elephant tusks in exchange for clothing, liquor, and firearms, but Ouro Preto miners preferred blacks shipped from the little beach of Ouidah on the Gulf of Guinea because they were more vigorous, lasted somewhat longer, and had the magic power to find gold. Every miner also needed a black mistress from Ouidah to bring him luck on his expeditions. (In Cuba, medicinal powers were attributed to female slaves. According to onetime slave Esteban Montejo, &quot;There was one type of sickness the whites picked up, a sickness of the veins and male organs. It could only be got rid of with black women; if the man who had it slept with a Negress he was cured immediately.&quot;) Ouro Preto's appetite for slaves became insatiable; they expired in short order, only in rare cases enduring the seven years of continuous labor. Yet the Portuguese were meticulous in baptizing them all before they crossed the Atlantic, and once in Brazil they were obliged to attend mass, although they were not allowed to sit in the pews or to enter the chanel.\r\n<br>\r\nThe gold explosion not only increased the importation of slaves, but absorbed a good part of the black labor from the sugar and tobacco plantations elsewhere in Brazil, leaving them without hands. The miners were contemptuous of farming, and in 1700 and 1713, in the full flush of prosperity, hunger stalked the region: millionaires had to eat cats, rats, ants, and birds of prey. A royal decree in 1711 banned the sale of slaves occupied in agriculture, with the exception of those who showed &quot;perversity of character.&quot;\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/middlepassageslavery.jpg" style="width:100%;break-after: always">\r\n<font class="caption">Scene in the hold of the "blood-stained Gloria".

The English planters had feared the rising power of the Maroons, and therefore tried to subdue them. This proved to be unsuccessful, consequently causing the English to realize that making peace with the Maroons was the only possible solution. This treaty was the first of its kind and it demonstrated that a group of rebellious ex-slaves had forced a powerful class of planters to come to terms. This was an unlikely event during the eighteenth century, given the dominance of the planter class across the Caribbean. Yet the fact remains that the treaty did not solely serve the planters’ interest. For example, article three of the treaty states that the Maroons were given 1500 acres of crown land, a necessity for the Maroons to maintain their independent way of life. In addition, it made a boundary between the Maroons and the planters, which was to avoid future conflicts.\r\n<br>\r\n<i> Pictured, a British illustration of the agreement</i>\r\n</p>\r\n	large	f

The revolt was scheduled for October 11, the anniversary of the King's coronation; a grand ball was to have been given in honor of the occasion, and the Negroes planned to blow up the Governor's house, the explosion serving as the signal for a general massacre of the whites. The ball was deferred on account of the Governor's son, and the conspiracy was betrayed by an accomplice. The chief figures in the plot included three waiting men, thirteen carpenters, eight coopers, one coppersmith, one sugar boiler, two masons, one butcher, twenty-six drivers, three coachmen, one head field negro, one millwright, three fishermen, one wheelwright, one 'obeah man', and three fiddlers—some of the most trusted and valuable slaves. The leader, who called himself King Court, and his two generals, Tomboy and Hercules, were broken on the wheel (<i>Pictured</i>); so were three others. Six slaves were gibbeted, seventy-seven burned alive, and thirty-six banished.\r\n<br>\r\nA commission of inquiry stated that the admission of slaves into 'occupations truly proper only for freemen' was an underlying cause of the insurrection, and it recommended that slaves should be debarred from becoming tradesmen, overseers, drivers, distillers, shopkeepers, hawkers, peddlers, sailers, fiddlers for gain, or from keeping horses or working out for themselves. Tomboy had been a master mason who had been allowed by his master to take negro apprentices and make what profit he could out of his own and their labor. He paid his owner a fixed sum per month, and it was stated that the remainder of his earnings had been invested in the revolt. </p>\r\n\r\n	large	f

Britain declares war against Spain, beginning the War of Jenkins’ Ear (1739-1748). The war is caused by disputes between the two powers over the Florida boundary but chiefly by the British determination to secure commercial mastery in the Caribbean. The justification for war is the alleged mistreatment by the Spanish of British seamen.\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the terms of the Treaty of Seville (1729), the British had agreed not to trade with the Spanish colonies. To verify this, the Spanish were allowed to board British vessels in Spanish waters. English sea captain Robert Jenkins of the <i>Rebecca</i> claims that in April 1731 during one such inspection, the Spanish cut off his ear. In 1738 Jenkins appears before the House of Commons in London and exhibits the ear, whipping up war fever and providing the name for the war. British prime minister Robert Walpole declares war on Spain on October 23, 1739, and Spain replies with its own declaration on November 28. In 1742 the conflict merges into the larger War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748).\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing initial British successes, the war sees indecisive naval operations against Cartagena; St. Augustine in Florida; Havana, Cuba; and Panama. Both sides also send out large numbers of privateers. The fighting eventually winds down as both sides \r\ndivert resources to the fighting in Europe. This war is settled by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, without gain of territory by either side.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<span style="color:#cc0000;">November 21, 1739</span><br>\r\nAs part of the War of Jenkins’ Ear, British capture of Portobelo. In the first major action of the war, on November 21, 1739, British\r\nVice Admiral Edward Vernon leads six ships of the line against the Spanish silver-transshipment port of Portobelo (Puerto Bello) in New Granada (present-day Panama). Vernon sends ashore a party of marines and sailors who, supported by his ships in the harbor, proceed to capture the well-built but inadequately manned Spanish shore fortifications.\r\n<br>\r\nVernon remains in Portobelo until March 1740, when he sails to Fort San Lorenzo at the mouth of the Chagres River, Panama. That fort surrenders after a two-day naval bombardment. After sacking the customhouse, Vernon demolishes the fort on March 29 and returns to Portobelo. These two easy and profitable victories are widely celebrated in Britain. In 1740 during a dinner in honor of Vernon in London, the song “God Save the King," now the British national anthem, is for the first time performed in public.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f

While the Pimas Altos (Upper Pima Indians) lived in the north, their linguistic brethren, the Pima Bajo (Lower Pima) lived farther south in lower Sonora.\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the 1740s, the Pima Indians began to feel agitated by the presence of the Spaniards in their territory. In November 1751, under the leadership of a Pima leader, Captain-General Luis Oacpicagigua, the Pima rose in revolt. Within a few days more than a hundred settlers, miners, and ranchers were killed. Churches were burned, and two priests were also killed. However, on January 4, 1752, approximately 2,000 northern Pimans attacked less than one hundred Spaniards, only to be repulsed with a loss of forty-three dead. The Pima Revolt lasted only four months, ending with the surrender of Luis Oacpicagigua, who offered himself in sacrifice and atonement for his whole people, endeavoring to spare them the consequences of their uprising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:90%;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n<strong>Who was Oacpicagigua?</strong><br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/1751pima.jpg" class="floatright">\r\n\r\nLuis Oacpicagigua was the leader of the Pima Revolt; little is known about his life before 1751. He had been appointed by the Spanish as the “Indian governor” of the province of Saric, and this obviously meant that they trusted him. Undoubtedly, Oacpicagigua must have spoken Spanish and been able to study some of their military tactics. He also had contact with the Seri, which helped him coordinate his attack on the Spanish. It is also recorded that he spoke many of the dialects of the Pima Indians. and this gave him an advantage in getting people from other tribes together to attack the Spanish.\r\n<br>\r\nThe outbreak of the revolt was the meeting Oacpicagigua held on November 20, 1751, where he outlined his plans to attack the Spanish. This shows that he clearly expected Spanish reprisals, and taken the precautions of moving the women and children into the mountains of Baboquivari so that they would not be able to be attacked when the revolt started. Certainly the first attack on the Spanish—the massacring of the 18 settlers when they came to visit Oacpicagigua at his house in Séric. showed that he recognized the need to have an incident to show that the revolt had started. However, the very lackluster nature of the subsequent attack\r\non the nearby mission, and then the rapid collapse of any really organized attack on the Spanish, points to another possible interpretation into the cause of the revolt.\r\n<br>\r\nOacpicagigua certainly knew about the war between the Spanish and the Seri, and he was well known to Diego Ortiz Parilla, who may have even encouraged him in his resentment of the Jesuits. Luis may also have known that the Spanish were planning to expand their settlements on the Gila and Colorado rivers. and felt he had to strike before this took place. In spite of this, Luis would have needed to persuade many people uncertain about attacking the Spanish to take part in the revolt, and it might also have been that the killing of the first settlers in  Oacpicagigua's own house was to show to them his commitment to the cause. Nevertheless, in spite of this, the revolt petered out fairly quickly. It failed to draw many of the Native Americans from Spanish settlements into it, and Luis  Oacpicagigua seemed to have recognized quickly the futility of any other major attacks, although isolated ones continuing for months.\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that his former friendship with Diego Ortiz Parilla had caused Luis Oacpicagigua to ﬁnally turn himself in. In May 1753, Oacpicagigua and another Pima Indian leader, Luis of Pitic, were asked to meet with the Spanish authorities. They were immediately arrested and brutally interrogated by the Spanish. Both tried to commit suicide in prison, but remained a|ive—Oacpicagigua remaining a prisoner until his death at Horcasitas Jail in early 1755.\r\n</p>	large	f
84	Brazilian Gold, African Slaves	1755	1755	eur1	economy	Open Veins of Latin America, Galeano	<p class="entry columns">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/slaverybrazil.gif" class="floatright">\r\n\r\n\r\nEngland and Holland, the leading gold and slave contrabandists, amassed fortunes in the illegal &quot;black meat&quot; traffic and are said to have illicitly garnered more than half the metal the Portuguese Crown was supposed to get from Brazil in quinto real tax. But Brazilian gold was channeled to London by licit as well as illicit methods. The gold boom, which brought a host of Portuguese to Minas Gerais, sharply stimulated colonial demand for industrial products and at the same time provided the means to pay for them. Just as Potosi silver rebounded off Spanish soil, Minas Gerais gold only reached Portugal in transit. The metropolis became an intermediary. In 1755 the Marquis de Pombal, Portugal's prime minister, tried to revive a protectionist policy, but it was too late. He declared that the English had conquered Portugal without the trouble of a conquest, that they were supplying two-thirds of its needs, and that British agents controlled the whole of Portuguese trade. Portugal was producing almost nothing, and the wealth brought by gold was so illusory that even the black slaves who mined it were clothed by the British.<br>\r\nCelso Furtado has noted that Britain, following a farsighted policy with respect to industrial development, used Brazilian gold to pay for essential imports from other countries and could thus concentrate on investments in the manufacturing sector. Thanks to this historical graciousness on the part of the Portuguese, Britain could apply rapid and efficient technical innovations. Europe's financial center moved from Amsterdam to London. According to British sources, the value of Brazilian gold arriving in London reached £50,000 a week in some periods. Without this tremendous accumulation of gold reserves, Britain would not have been able, later on, to confront Napoleon.</p>	large	f

251	The Occupation Before Trujillo	1916	1924	domrep1	power	The Military and the State in Latin America  by Alain Rouquié	<p class="entry columns3" style="position:relative;top:-68px;">\r\n<font style="color:#cc0000;font-weight:bold;">In 1916, the US invades the Dominican Republic and occupies the country until 1924. The US military kicks peasants off land illegitimately owned by (mostly American) sugar companies, creates the National Police Force, and strictly controls the expression of dissent through censorship and imprisonment. U.S. Marines train the police forces that bring Rafael Leonidas Trujillo to power in 1930.</font>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;In the eastern and Spanish-speaking part of the island of Hispaniola, the Dominican Republic was also occupied by the Marines in 1916 under similar conditions to those of its French-speaking neighbor, Haiti. Instability and bankruptcy were the two pretexts for intervention. In the seventy years of independence since the end of Haitian control of that part of the island in 1844, the Dominican Republic had had twenty-three victorious revolutions. Civil war was the sole functioning mechanism for the transfer of political power. An elite of large landholders fought for control of the government by force of arms without establishing either a stable democracy or a permanent and effective dictatorship. The specialization of agricultural production seems to have been the cause of the fragmentation of the ruling groups. One spoke of the cocoa oligarch, the sugar imperialist, and the tobacco democrat. The governors of the provinces were actually local military leaders.\r\n<br>&emsp;Faced with the anarchy produced by the warlords, who with their military uprisings and civil wars helped to increase the national debt, the United States here as elsewhere dictated the establishment of a "neutral" police force in 1916. \r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/dominicanrepublicinvasion1916.jpg" style="width:100%;"><br>\r\n<font class="caption">The invasion force rowing into the City of Monte Cristi on the North Coast of the Dominican Republic</font>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in the Dominican Republic it was not content to prop up a government or to place it under tutelage. The United States simply abolished the local regime and replaced it with a military government with American officers as members of the cabinet. The principal direct consequence of foreign occupation was to destroy the military power of the semi-independent caudillos and to centralize the administration of the country.\r\n The National Guard created by the marines thus became the first regular standing army in the history of the Dominican Republic.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nWhile the resistance to the invader was more localized and less widespread than in the other occupied countries in the\r\narea, the new National Guard was seen as a substitute army for the occupiers and a foreign body. The Dominican bourgeoisie was largely hostile to the United States, and leading families refused to allow their offspring to become colonial officers. Also, the American authorities who recruited enlisted men among the lower-class elements in the cities were unconcerned with the past conduct of the future officers, who were publicly denounced in the press as traitors to the nation.\r\n<br>&emsp;Thus it was that a former telegraph operator and later chief of the private police force of a sugar plantation joined the gendarmerie of the marines. His rise was meteoric—lieutenant in 1919, captain in 1922, commandant in 1924, and chief of the general staff in 1928. The man with this less than brilliant background, <a data-entry="263" data-year="1930" class="inline">Rafael Leonidas Trujillo</a>, would soon be a generalissimo. The future "satrap of the Dominican Republic," the "little Caesar of the Caribbean," had the confidence of the marines. His dictatorship was again the poisoned fruit of the Yankee occupation.\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f
227	Vaccine Revolt	1904	1904	bra8	redfist	Afro-Latin America, 1800-2000 By George Reid Andrews	<p class="entry columns">\r\n<img src="../mapimages/vaccinerevolt1904brazil.jpg" class="floatleft">\r\n\r\n&emsp;"Urban reforms" were aimed not just at modernizing cities' infrastructure but at transforming their class and racial composition. Over the course\r\nof the 1800s, workers had crowded into decaying colonial-era mansions and\r\nhouses that had been subdivided into tenements that went by different names in\r\ndifferent countries: <i>Conventillos</i> (little convents) in Argentina and Uruguay; <i>cortiços</i> (beehives) and <i>cabeças de  porco</i> (hogsheads) in Brazil; <i>solares</i> (mansions) in\r\nCuba. As the export boom attracted growing numbers of migrants to the region's\r\ncities, these urban slum communities grow as well. Their overcrowding and crude\r\nsanitary conditions contributed to high urban death rates, crime, and occasional\r\noutbreaks of epidemic disease that threatened all city dwellers. And throughout\r\nAfro-Latin America, they were heavily black and mulatto. In Brazil and Cuba,\r\nwhere thousands of recently freed libertos sought to escape their recent servitude\r\nby moving to the cities, they were overwhelmingly so. Surveys of Havana slums\r\nfound that 95 percent or more of their inhabitants were black and mulatto. In\r\nRio de Janeiro, black migrants from Bahia streamed into the center-city neighborhood\r\nnext to the docks, which became known as Little Africa. As that neighborhood\r\nfilled up, other Bahian migrants built Rio's first <i>favela</i>, a community of\r\nmakeshift huts and shacks on a hill behind the Ministry of War. Over the course\r\nof the 1900s, favelas spread throughout the city and became a ubiquitous form of\r\nhousing for the poor, who, as at the turn of the century. were predominantly\r\nAfro-Brazilian.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIt was largely in order to remove poverty and blackness from the city center\r\nthat the federal government demolished and rebuilt much of Rio's downtown in\r\nthe early 1900s, expelling the cortiços' inhabitants to squalid, remote suburbs\r\nalong the railroad line north of the city. Center-city residents fought back with\r\nthe Vaccine Revolt, a week of urban riots in 1904. The immediate cause of the rebellion\r\nwas a government campaign to vaccinate the population against smallpox,\r\nin which health officials entered working-class homes, often without permission,\r\nand inoculated every member of the family. Poor families reacted\r\nangrily to this aggressive state intrusion into the home, and they protested as well\r\nthe destruction of inner-city neighborhoods that had provided affordable housing\r\nnear their places of work. Many, perhaps most, of the rioters were Afro-Brazilian.\r\nAs one such protestor was carried off to jail. he shouted to the crowd that he\r\nwas fighting "to show the government that it can't put its foot on the people's\r\nneck .... Every now and then it's good for black folk to show that we know how to\r\ndie like men!"\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nFederal troops and police easily put down the Vaccine Revolt, and the government\r\npushed on with its program of urban renewal. Ultimately, however, Latin\r\nAmerican governments' ability to rebuild their urban centers was limited.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="caption"><i>Pictured</i>, Streetcar turned over\r\nafter the revolt.\r\n</p>	large	f

Reportedly, runaway slaves living in the quilombo Campo Grande had plotted a rebellion that never actually took place. \r\n<br>\r\nOne of the most important quilombos in colonial Brazil was Campo Grande, which consisted of some twenty-five different settlements. By the 1750s, its population had surpassed 20,000. This quilombo was also significant because it seems that in addition to runaway slaves, many of the original inhabitants were free blacks and mulatoes and poor whites. \r\n<br>\r\nIn 1756, the inhabitants of Campo Grande purportedly planned a rebellion, in which they would join with slaves against the European colonists in Minas Gerais. According to rumors at the time, the Africans were planning to attack on holy Thursday while the white Brazilians attended church services. Reportedly, they would kill all of the white and mulatto men, while sparing the women. The plot never came to fruition, perhaps because it was discovered before it began, although there is no real evidence that the plot was genuine. This incident is important, however, in that it demonstrates the extent to which white Brazilians feared runaway black communities. (Ronald Young)</p>\r\n\r\n	large	f

Like their leader, Tacky, nearly all of the rebels were African-born Akans—called Coromantees in Jamaica—from the West African coast then known as the Gold Coast, now Ghana. While destroying property and creating panic among the whites, the rebels avoided outright battles with army regulars and militia. The military forces were supported by many of the island's maroons, who had gained their freedom by promising to assist authorities in putting down slave revolts and returning fugitives. After more than a year of fighting, the combined force of soldiers, militia, and maroons defeated the rebels in the summer of 1761. \r\n<br>\r\nMany rebels, including Tacky, were killed before the revolt was suppressed. Sporadic fighting continued in western Jamaica for months, and martial law was maintained until October 1761. By the time the last rebels surrendered, between three hundred and four hundred rebels had been killed, along with sixty whites and sixty free blacks. About 350 rebels were arrested, of whom about one hundred were brutally executed—some were slowly burned and others suspended and starved to death. Several rebels committed suicide rather than submit to torture and a more brutal death, and many were deported to the penal colony in British Honduras (now Belize).</p>	large	f

Klein and Slave Rebellions by  Slavery in the Americas, Robin Santos Doak	<p class="entry columns">Berbice Slave revolts erupts in the Dutch colony of Berbice (modern-day Guyana).\r\nIn February 1763, a huge uprising rocked Berbice, a Dutch colony on South America's northeast coast that is now part of Guyana. In 1581, the Dutch had colonized the region, setting up sugar plantations and bringing slave labor from Africa. As in many other European colonies outside of the 13 British colonies, the number of slaves in Guyana greatly outnumbered whites. At the time of the 1763 revolt, the population of blacks in the colony was about 10 times greater than that of whites.\r\n<br>Known as the Great Rebellion, the revolt in Guyana involved as many as half the slaves in the entire colony. Triggered by the cruel treatment of slaves, the rebellion began on one plantation where slaves killed their overseer and a carpenter and burned down the owner's house. The rebels then marched from plantation to plantation, and at each, unhappy slaves joined the cause. During the rebellion, many whites were killed, and many plantations and fields were burned.The uprising was led by a slave named Cuffy, a cooper(barrel maker) in the colony. Cuffy and his army of slaves eventually overthrew the Dutch government and took control. The rebels managed to stay in power for more than a year before being defeated by European forces. \r\n<br>By late March, the slave rebels controlled most of the colony, but they were not able to take the island's largest fort. Eventually, reinforcements arrived and aided by conflict within rebel ranks were able to reestablish control over the colony. About 60 percent of the whites died during the rebellion and almost 40 percent of the slaves. Of the rebels, 128 were executed in various cruel ways designed to dissuade the slaves from further revolts. As the rebellion fell apart, Cuffy took his own life to avoid being tortured and executed. Today, he is considered a national hero in Guyana.</p>	large	f

This was Bacon's Rebellion. After the uprising was suppressed, its\r\nleader, Nathaniel Bacon, dead, and his associates hanged, Bacon was described in a Royal\r\nCommission report:\r\n<br><span class="blockquote"  style="font-style: italic;font-size:1.1em;color: #cc0000;">\r\nHe was said to be about four or five and thirty years of age, indifferent tall but slender, black-hair'd\r\nand of an ominous, pensive, melancholly Aspect, of a pestilent and prevalent Logical discourse\r\ntending to atheisme... . He seduced the Vulgar and most ignorant people to believe (two thirds of\r\neach county being of that Sort) Soe that their whole hearts and hopes were set now upon Bacon.\r\nNext he charges the Governour as negligent and wicked, treacherous and incapable, the Lawes and\r\nTaxes as unjust and oppressive and cryes up absolute necessity of redress. Thus Bacon encouraged\r\nthe Tumult and as the unquiet crowd follow and adhere to him, he listeth them as they come in\r\nupon a large paper, writing their name circular wise, that their Ringleaders might not be found out.\r\nHaving connur'd them into this circle, given them Brandy to wind up the charme, and enjoyned\r\nthem by an oath to stick fast together and to him and the oath being administered, he went and\r\ninfected New Kent County ripe for Rebellion.\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="another page"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="background-color:white;padding:9px;">\r\n&emsp;\r\nBacon's Rebellion began with conflict over how to deal with the Indians, who were close by, on the\r\nwestern frontier, constantly threatening. Whites who had been ignored when huge land grants\r\naround Jamestown were given away had gone west to find land, and there they encountered\r\nIndians. Were those frontier Virginians resentful that the politicos and landed aristocrats who\r\ncontrolled the colony's government in Jamestown first pushed them westward into Indian territory,\r\nand then seemed indecisive in fighting the Indians? That might explain the character of their\r\nrebellion, not easily classifiable as either antiaristocrat or anti-Indian, because it was both.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAnd the governor, William Berkeley, and his Jamestown crowd-were they more conciliatory to the\r\nIndians (they wooed certain of them as spies and allies) now that they had monopolized the land in\r\nthe East, could use frontier whites as a buffer, and needed peace? The desperation of the\r\ngovernment in suppressing the rebellion seemed to have a double motive: developing an Indian\r\npolicy which would divide Indians in order to control them (in New England at this very time,\r\nMassasoit's son Metacom was threatening to unite Indian tribes, and had done frightening damage\r\nto Puritan settlements in "King Philip's War"); and teaching the poor whites of Virginia that\r\nrebellion did not pay-by a show of superior force, by calling for troops from England itself, by\r\nmass hanging.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Violence had escalated on the frontier before the rebellion. Some Doeg Indians took a few hogs to redress a debt, and whites, retrieving the hogs, murdered two Indians. The Doegs then sent out a\r\nwar party to kill a white herdsman, after which a white militia company killed twenty-four Indians.\r\nThis led to a series of Indian raids, with the Indians, outnumbered, turning to guerrilla warfare. The\r\nHouse of Burgesses in Jamestown declared war on the Indians, but proposed to exempt those\r\nIndians who cooperated. This seemed to anger the frontiers people, who wanted total war but also\r\nresented the high taxes assessed to pay for the war.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nTimes were hard in 1676. "There was genuine distress, genuine poverty.... All contemporary\r\nsources speak of the great mass of people as living in severe economic straits," writes Wilcomb\r\nWashburn, who, using British colonial records, has done an exhaustive study of Bacon's Rebellion.\r\nIt was a dry summer, ruining the corn crop, which was needed for food, and the tobacco crop,\r\nneeded for export. Governor Berkeley, in his seventies, tired of holding office, wrote wearily about\r\nhis situation: "How miserable that man is that Governes a People where six parts of seaven at least\r\nare Poore Endebted Discontented and Armed."\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nHis phrase "six parts of seaven" suggests the existence of an upper class not so impoverished. In\r\nfact, there was such a class already developed in Virginia. Bacon himself came from this class, had\r\na good bit of land, and was probably more enthusiastic about killing Indians than about redressing\r\nthe grievances of the poor. But he became a symbol of mass resentment against the Virginia\r\nestablishment, and was elected in the spring of 1676 to the House of Burgesses. When he insisted\r\non organizing armed detachments to fight the Indians, outside official control, Berkeley proclaimed\r\nhim a rebel and had him captured, whereupon two thousand Virginians marched into Jamestown to\r\nsupport him. Berkeley let Bacon go, in return for an apology, but Bacon went off, gathered his\r\nmilitia, and began raiding the Indians.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;\r\nBacon's "Declaration of the People" of July 1676 shows a mixture of populist resentment against\r\nthe rich and frontier hatred of the Indians. It indicted the Berkeley administration for unjust taxes,\r\nfor putting favorites in high positions, for monopolizing the beaver trade, and for not protecting the\r\nwestern formers from the Indians. Then Bacon went out to attack the friendly Pamunkey Indians,\r\nkilling eight, taking others prisoner, plundering their possessions.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThere is evidence that the rank and file of both Bacon's rebel army and Berkeley's official army\r\nwere not as enthusiastic as their leaders. There were mass desertions on both sides, according to\r\nWashburn. In the fall, Bacon, aged twenty-nine, fell sick and died, because of, as a contemporary\r\nput it, "swarmes of Vermyn that bred in his body." A minister, apparently not a sympathizer, wrote\r\nthis epitaph:\r\n<span class="blockquote" style="font-style: italic;font-size:1.1em;color: #cc0000;">\r\nBacon is Dead I am sorry at my heart,<br>\r\nThat lice and flux should take the hangmans part.\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="another page"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="background-color:white;padding:9px;">\r\n\r\n&emsp;\r\nThe rebellion didn't last long after that. A ship armed with thirty guns, cruising the York River,\r\nbecame the base for securing order, and its captain, Thomas Grantham, used force and deception to\r\ndisarm the last rebel forces. Coming upon the chief garrison of the rebellion, he found four hundred\r\narmed Englishmen and Negroes, a mixture of free men, servants, and slaves. He promised to\r\npardon everyone, to give freedom to slaves and servants, whereupon they surrendered their arms\r\nand dispersed, except for eighty Negroes and twenty English who insisted on keeping their arms.\r\nGrantham promised to take them to a garrison down the river, but when they got into the boat, he\r\ntrained his big guns on them, disarmed them, and eventually delivered the slaves and servants to\r\ntheir masters. The remaining garrisons were overcome one by one. Twenty-three rebel leaders were\r\nhanged.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;It was a complex chain of oppression in Virginia. The Indians were plundered by white\r\nfrontiersmen, who were taxed and controlled by the Jamestown elite. And the whole colony was\r\nbeing exploited by England, which bought the colonists' tobacco at prices it dictated and made\r\n100,000 pounds a year for the King.

This mestizo chief, a direct descendant of the Inca emperors, headed the broadest of messianic revolutionary movements. The rebellion broke out in Tinta province, which had been almost depopulated by enforced service in the Cerro Rico mines. Mounted on his white horse, Tupac Amaru entered the plaza of Tungasuca and announced to the sound of drums and pututus that he had condemned the royal Corregidor Antonio Juan de Arriaga to the gallows and put an end to the Potosi mita. A few days later Tupac issued a decree liberating the slaves. He abolished all taxes and forced labor in all forms. The Indians rallied by the thousands to the forces of the &quot;father of all the poor and all the wretched and helpless.&quot; He moved against Cuzco at the head of his guerilleros, promising them that all who died while under his orders in this war would return to life to enjoy the happiness and wealth the invaders had wrested from them. Victories and defeats followed; in the end, betrayed and captured by one of his own chiefs, Tupac was handed over in chains to the royalists. The Examiner Areche entered his cell to demand, in exchange for promises, the names of his rebel accomplices. Tupac Amaru replied scornfully, &quot;There are no accomplices here but you and I. You, the oppressor and I, the liberator. Both of us deserve death!&quot;<img src="/mapimages/tupac-amaru-execution.jpg" style="padding:12px;column-span:all;">\r\nTupac was tortured, along with his wife, his children, and his chief aides, in Cuzco's Plaza del Wacaypata. His tongue was cut out; his arms and legs were tied to four horses with the intention of quartering him, but his body would not break; he was finally beheaded at the foot of the gallows. His head was sent to Tinta, one arm to Tungasuca and the other to Carabaya, one leg to Santa Rosa and the other to Livitaca. The torso was burned and the ashes thrown in the Rio Watanay. It was proposed that all his descendants be obliterated up to the fourth generation.\r\n<br>\r\nNearly two centuries had to pass after Tupac Amaru's death before the nationalist general Juan Velasco Alvarado would take up and apply Tupac's resounding, never forgotten words: &quot;Campesino!

The principal cause of outrage was the procedure of the regent and visitor-general, Juan Francisco Gutierrez de Pineres, whose ruthless methods and uncompromising demands contrasted harshly with the traditional process of bargain and compromise. He increased the alcabala sales tax to 4 per cent, took it out of farm into direct administration and revived an obsolete tax for naval defense. He also reorganized the tobacco and spirits monopolies, increasing the price to the consumer and, in the case of tobacco, restricting production to high quality areas. These burdens fell on a stagnant economy, poor population and, above all, numerous small farmers. After a series of protests and disturbances, initiated by a woman shopkeeper, Manuela Beltrán, ripping down the edict and declaring "long live the king and death to bad government!", serious rebellion broke out on March 16,1781 centered on Socorro and San Gil. The rebels refused to pay taxes, attacked government warehouses, drove out the Spanish authorities and, in the name of the común, proclaimed a group of leaders. The chief of these was Juan Francisco Berbeo, a hacendado of modest means and some military experience. And soon a movement which began as a popular and predominantly mestizo insurrection came under the command of the Creole elite of land and office, who joined it with some trepidation in order to control what they could not prevent.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe comuneros were a powerful force, at least in numbers, and a horde many thousands strong marched on Bogota, together with a band of Indians. They could have broken into the capital and imposed a reign of terror on Spaniards and Creoles alike. But Berbeo and his associates were not revolutionaries. The cry of their movement was the traditional one, 'Long live the king and death to bad government'. The tyranny they opposed was that of the Spanish bureaucracy, not the structure of colonial society. Berbeo and the other Creoles, therefore, held back the rebel army, preferring to negotiate with Archbishop Caballero y Gongora and indirectly with the elite in Bogota. This was the traditional way, and the result was a compromise settlement, the capitulations of Zipaquira (June 8, 1781). These provided for the suppression of the tobacco monopoly and of various taxes; the restriction and reduction of the alcabala from 4 to 2 per cent; certain administrative reforms favoring local self-government; greater access to office for Americans; and improved conditions for the Indians.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nHowever, the negotiations are not brokered in good faith and several of the Comunero leaders will be executed.\r\n</p>	large	f

British prime minister William Pitt the Younger (1783-1806) and his first lord of the Admiralty, Lord Melville (1802-1806), were keenly interested in Latin America. They did not approve of a unilateral venture headed by General Sir William Beresford and Commodore Sir Hope Popham in 1806. On 27 June, Beresford's force of 1,600 men, which had sailed front Cape Town across the Atlantic, landed outside the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, all without permission from the Crown. Beresford deposed the Spanish viceroy and declared himself governor of Buenos Aires under the authority of King George III. Just one British soldier was killed in the capture of Buenos Aires. The escapade did not last long.<br> Local aristocrats united to defeat the British in August 1806, and, rather generously, the British force was allowed to sail back to London. The spark of freedom had been planted in Latin America. British pride had also been affronted, but a second expedition against Buenos Aires in 1808, led by Lieutenant General John Whitlocke, was even more catastrophic. The British lost 2,200 men in the fighting. \r\n</p>\r\n<i>Pictured, Beresford surrenders to Santiago de Liniers</i>	large	f

The Venezuelan rebel, personally opposed to slavery, offered freedom in return for 10 years military service.\r\n<br>\r\nFrancisco de Miranda, who had read the works of the\r\n<i>philosophes</i> during his army service in Spain in the 1770s, transformed\r\nideology into activism. It was in New York, in 1784, that Francisco de Miranda conceived\r\nthe idea of 'the liberty and independence of the whole Spanish American\r\ncontinent'. The model of revolution offered by France had less appeal. As\r\nMiranda observed in 1799, &quot;We have before our eyes two great examples,\r\nthe American and the French Revolutions. Let us prudently imitate the\r\nfirst and carefully shun the second.&quot; <br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/arturomichelena.jpg" style="float: right; margin:5px 9px 5px 5px; max-height:40%;max-width:40%;">\r\nSpanish American revolutionaries anxiously disassociated themselves\r\nfrom the Haitian revolution. Miranda in particular was concerned about\r\nits effect on his reputation in England: &quot;I confess that much as I desire the\r\nliberty and independence of the New World, I fear anarchy and revolution\r\neven more. God forbid that the other countries suffer the same fate\r\nas Saint-Domingue, scene of carnage and crimes, committed on the\r\npretext of establishing liberty; better that they should remain another\r\ncentury under the barbarous and senseless oppression of Spain.&quot;\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nMiranda argued that it was vital for him to reach Venezuela first, before\r\nthe Haitians did, and in 1806 he led a tiny expedition to his homeland.\r\nUnfortunately for his reputation he stopped to re-group in Haiti, where\r\nhe was advised not to be content with exhorting the Creoles to rise but &quot;to\r\ncut off heads and burn property&quot;, and where a rumour started that he\r\nplanned to use black Haitians. In fact, Miranda was as socially conservative\r\nas other Creoles and he had no intention of inciting a race war. But\r\nthe damage was done. At Coro he was met first by a stony silence then by\r\nopposition from Creole landowners, who denounced him as a &quot;heretic&quot;\r\nand a &quot;traitor&quot;.\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time both mantuanos and the population at large rallied to the side of the Spanish\r\nauthorities against Miranda, whose call for outright independence still\r\nappeared too radical. The fear of inadvertently setting off a Haitian-style\r\nuprising among slaves and free pardos, who together amounted to over\r\nhalf the population of Venezuela, was a particular reason for caution\r\namong upper-class Creoles. At the same time, fear of the masses was an\r\nimportant reason for not leaving the maintenance of order to the\r\nappointed servants of a weakening and seemingly unreliable Spanish\r\ngovernment, which had already on various occasions shown itself too\r\nwilling to encourage the aspirations of the <i>pardos</i>.\r\n<br>\r\n Simon Bolívar, who followed Miranda as a leading figure in Venezuelan revolutionary circles (and who was a member of the group that arrested Miranda and turned him over to the Spanish), actively recruited slaves beginning in 1816, and would not have succeeded without drawing them away from the royalist cause.<br>\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f

The hostages were released in return for arms.\r\nU.S. marines guarded the railroad office, the U.S. consulate, and the Pacific Mail wharf, but some people apparently used the chaos to loot properties owned by the French canal company. The company formed a guard that included U.S. marines, who caught dozens of the looters. "All caught red handed were immediately tried and on the following day shot," the New York Times reported. "Fifty-eight persons, among whom, it is believed, were several innocent people, were thus summarily despatched." Defeated by government troops, Prestan fled by boat to Cartagena.

I make use of this right to protests against the horrible crime you accuse me of, and so that the world knows that he who today you call the incendiarist of Colon is innocent before God and before men of good will.

As the population grew, all of the maroon communities found the original land allotment from the 1739 treaty to be inadequate, and by the 1790s Trelawny Town was suffering from a land shortage.&nbsp; At the same time, the town was experiencing a weakening of local authority.&nbsp; Many members of the community were very aggrieved by the British appointments of town superintendent in 1792 and 1794; the latter, Thomas Craskell, was thought to be particularly inept. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe immediate spark of the war occurred in July 1795 when two Trelawny Maroons were convicted of stealing pigs in Montego Bay in St. James parish.&nbsp; That parish magistrates rather than Trelawny authorities sentenced the offenders was a breach of the 1739 treaty.&nbsp; Furthermore, for the fiercely independent Maroons, the fact that their punishment, flogging, was administered by a slave (who had in fact been a runaway recovered by the Maroons) and before an audience of slaves, was exceptionally offensive.&nbsp; In the furor that began with the news of the flogging, the superintendent, Craskell, was forcibly ejected from Trelawny Town.\r\n<br>&emsp;In an effort to address Trelawny grievances regarding land, Craskell, and the flogging, numerous magistrates, local property owners, and a former, well-respected superintendent met with Trelawny authorities to discuss their concerns and offer redress.&nbsp; Despite the initial success of these negotiations, Governor Balcarres sent a letter to Britain’s Secretary for War suggesting that the French may have prompted the Maroon insurrection.&nbsp; Balcarres opposed the conciliatory efforts of the magistrates and pressed for military suppression of what, he claimed, was an imminent threat.&nbsp; Balcarres declared martial law and demanded the surrender of all Trelawny Maroons capable of bearing arms.&nbsp; The thirty-seven men who complied were imprisoned.&nbsp; Soon after, approximately 300 Maroons attacked and defeated the St. James parish militia; this was the opening battle of a nine-month engagement with British troops composed of military regulars and residents, including slaves as well as Accompong Maroon mercenaries.&nbsp; Free Afro-Jamaicans composed about one-third of the Jamaica militia.\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Causes"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="background-color:white; padding:9px;">&emsp;While numerous slaves were pressed into British service, roughly 100 to 250 defected to the Trelawny side.&nbsp; Some free Afro-Jamaicans joined the Maroon warriors as well.&nbsp; The combined force of Trewlany Maroons, slaves, and Afro-Jamaicans totaling approximately 500 sustained a successful guerilla war against much larger British forces (approximately 2500).&nbsp; Unable to secure a military victory, Balcarres proposed peace in late October, 1795.&nbsp; In December, British Major-General George Walpole wrote to Balcarres of a truce agreement he had reached with the Trelawny Maroons on the condition that they would not be deported.\r\n<br>&emsp;On December 28 Balcarres declared that the treaty would be ratified when the Trelawny Maroons met at his headquarters on January 1, 1796.&nbsp; Balcarres may have once again deliberately manipulated circumstances as the conditions of communication and travel made the three-day time frame unfeasible.&nbsp; When only three Trelawny men arrived on the first of the year, Balcarres issued <em>chasseurs</em>, the handlers of Cuban bloodhounds used throughout the Caribbean (including the First Maroon War) to track maroons, rebel slaves, and criminals.&nbsp; Many Trelawny Maroons were en route, in good faith, to Balcarres’ headquarters while others, remotely situated, may not have even learned of the treaty for several weeks.&nbsp; Some 150 fugitive slaves refused to surrender.&nbsp; Several Maroon bands continued to rout their opponents, most notably, the thirty-six combatants led by Maroon captain Leonard Parkinson, whose exploits became legendary and whose surrender at the end of March signaled the de facto end of the war.\r\n<br>&emsp;By March 1796, large numbers of Trelawny Maroons had complied with the conditions of the treaty (excepting the January 1 date) and surrendered their arms.&nbsp; Like those who had acquiesced to Balcarres at the start of war, the Trewlany Maroons were imprisoned in warships off the coast of Montego Bay.&nbsp; Recaptured rebel slaves, free blacks, and many of the Maroons were sentenced to whipping and imprisonment.&nbsp; In express violation of the terms of the treaty, Balcarras deported nearly 600 Maroons to Nova Scotia in 1796.&nbsp; Many, including Major-General Walpole, were outraged by Balcarres’ patent breech of trust.&nbsp; As a result, Walpole resigned his post in Jamaica and rejected the disbursement offered to him and Balcarres by the Jamaican Assembly.&nbsp; Discontent in Canada, the Trelawny Maroons petitioned the British government and, as did many of the African-American loyalists who emigrated to Nova Scotia after the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, they ultimately settled in Sierra Leone.&nbsp;

With the seat of the Portuguese government in Rio de Janeiro, many of the old restrictions on trade and commerce disappeared. Most important, the government opened Brazil's ports to British trade and merchants, manufacturing was encouraged, schools and institutions of higher education were constructed, and a new army was formed. (Everything changed again when Napoleon was defeated in 1815. Many Brazilian men and women were initially optimistic when Portugal granted Brazil coequal status as a kingdom in 1816, but Portuguese in Portugal gradually reconstructed their country and demanded that mercantilism be restored and that King João return to Portugal in 1821. Both João and his son, Pedro, recognized that too much had changed to return to the days when Brazil was a colony. Thus, as he left for Portugal, João advised his son to be ready to seize the crown of Brazil if demands for independence accelerated. Under pressure from the Portuguese Côrtes and Portuguese troops in Brazil, Pedro issued his &quot;fico&quot; or declaration that &quot;I am staying&quot; on January 9, 1822. He created a new government with some Brazilian advisors then announced &quot;Independence or Death&quot; on September 7, 1822. Three months later he was crowned Pedro I and became a more-or-less constitutional Emperor, who, nonetheless, had the power to dissolve the national assembly.)</p>\r\n<p class="caption"><i>Pictured</i>,The Queluz National Palace, Quelez, Lisbon, Portuga, fled in 1807.</p>\r\n</div>	large	f

Hidalgo, who till the age of fifty was a peaceable rural priest, pealed the bells of the church of Dolores one fine day to summon the Indians to fight for their freedom: &quot;Will you stir yourselves to the task of recovering from the hated Spaniards the lands robbed from your ancestors 300 years ago?&quot; He raised the standard of the Indian Virgin of Guadalupe and before six weeks were out 80,000 men were following him, armed with machetes, pikes, slings, and bows and arrows. The revolutionary priest put an end to tribute and divided up the lands of Guadalajara; he decreed freedom for the slaves and led his forces toward Mexico City. He was finally executed after a military defeat and is said to have left a testament of passionate repentance. \r\n<br>\r\n  \r\nThe revolution soon found another leader, however, the priest Jose Maria Morelos: &quot;You must regard as enemies all the rich, the nobles, and high-ranking officials . . .&quot; His movement—combining Indian insurgency and social revolution—came to control a large part of Mexico before he too was defeated and shot.

123	Simon Bolivar takes command of Venezuelan independence forces.	1813	1813	ven1	redstar		<p class="entry columns">Simon Bolivar (1783-1830) takes command of Venezuelan independence forces. He issues this Proclamation:\r\n<br>\r\n"An army of our brothers, sent by the Sovereign Congress of New Granada, has come to liberate you. Having expelled the oppressors from the provinces of Merida and Trujillo, it is now among you. \r\n<br>\r\nWe are sent to destroy the Spaniards, to protect the Americans, and to reestablish the republican governments that once formed the Confederation of Venezuela. The states defended by our arms are again governed by their former constitutions and tribunals, in full enjoyment of their liberty and independence, for our mission is designed only to break the chains of servitude which shackle some of our towns, and not to impose laws or exercise acts of dominion to which the rules of war might entitle us. \r\n<br>Moved by your misfortunes, we have been unable to observe with indifference the afflictions you were forced to experience by the barbarous Spaniards, who have ravished you, plundered you, and brought you death and destruction. They have violated the sacred rights of nations. They have broken the most solemn agreements and treaties. In fact, they have committed every manner of crime, reducing the Republic of Venezuela to the most frightful desolation. Justice therefore demands vengeance, and necessity compels us to exact it. Let the monsters who infest Colombian soil, who have drenched it in blood, be cast out forever; may their punishment be equal to the enormity of their perfidy, so that we my eradicate the stain of our ignominy and demonstrate to the nations of the world that the sons of America cannot be offended with impunity. <br>\r\nDespite our just resentment toward the ubiquitous Spaniards, our magnanimous heart still commands us to open to them for the last time a path to reconciliation and friendship; they are invited to live peacefully among us, if they will abjure their crimes, honestly change their ways, and cooperate with us in destroying the intruding Spanish government and the reestablishment of the Republic of Venezuela.<br>\r\n Any Spaniard who does not, by every active and effective means, work against tyranny in behalf of this just cause, will be considered an enemy and punished; as a traitor to the nation, he will inevitably be shot by a firing squad. On the other hand, general and absolute amnesty is granted to those who come over to our army with or without their arms, as well as to those who render aid to the good citizens who are endeavoring to throw off the yoke of tyranny. Army officers and civil magistrates who proclaim the government of Venezuela and join us shall retain their posts and positions; in a word, those Spaniards who render outstanding service to the State shall be regarded and treated as Americans. \r\n<br>And you Americans who, by error or treachery, have been lured from the paths of justice, are informed that your brothers, deeply regretting the error of your ways, have pardoned you as we are profoundly convinced that you cannot be truly to blame, for only the blindness and ignorance in which you have been kept up to now by those responsible for your crimes could have induced you to commit them. Fear not the sword that comes to avenge you and to sever the ignoble ties with which your executioners have bound you to their own fate. You are hereby assured, with absolute impunity, of your honor, lives, and property. The single title, "Americans," shall be your safeguard and guarantee. Our arms have come to protect you, and they shall never be raised against a single one of you, our brothers.<br>\r\n This amnesty is extended even to the very traitors who most recently have committed felonious acts, and it shall be so religiously applied that no reason, cause, or pretext will be sufficient to oblige us to violate our offer, however extraordinary and extreme the occasion you may give to provoke our wrath. <br>Spaniards and Canary Islanders, you will die, though you be neutral, unless you actively espouse the cause of America's liberation. Americans, you will live, even if you have trespassed."<br>\r\nGeneral Headquarters, Trujill, June 15, 1813</p>	large	t

Bolivar escapes to New Granada (present-day Colombia and Panama).</i>\r\n<br>With the fall of Napoleon (1814), Fernando VII returned to the Spanish throne. The king sent reinforcements to support the loyalists in Venezuela. In addition to the Spanish royalists, the republicans had other enemies. Many <i>criolla</i> planters refused to free their slaves, and breaking up the continued slave revolts thinned the patriot army. Furthermore, under the Spanish merchant and smuggler Jose Tomas Boves (1782-1814), many llaneros deserted the patriot cause in response to the continued enforcement of the llanera vagrancy laws. <br>\r\nThe Spanish army continued to attack, its ranks swelled with fresh recruits. The llaneros swept across the highlands toward Caracas, where a weakened republican army frantically awaited reinforcements from Colombia and hoped that the British might change their mind and send help. Boves and Bolivar fought several battles against each other's forces. Bolivar won most of the battles but lost the war. The patriots retreated eastward, and Boves recaptured each city in their wake. Valencia surrendered, hoping to ease the trauma, but the llaneros rounded up all the patriot supporters and executed them, treating their families with great cruelty. Boves was notorious for this cruelty toward the enemy during the Venezuelan struggle for independence. \r\n<br>Like Miranda before him, Bolivar readied a ship at La Guaira with the treasury and the silver and jewels he had taken from various churches in Caracas, so that he could buy arms in the British Antilles. He retreated to Barcelona, in the state of Anzoategui, where his forces were again defeated. The survivors pushed toward Cumana, where Bolivar boarded his ship to stop the captain from leaving with the treasury. In September 1819, Bolivar sailed for Cartagena to regroup. The remainder of his forces retreated farther east and were continuously harassed by Bovees. By December the patriots had been defeated in the east, although Boves lost his life in battle. By this time, only a handful of guerrillas remained in the west. The Second Republic was dead and Venezuela lay in ruins.  War had reduced its population, while disease and malnutrition afflicted scores of others. \r\n</p>\r\n	large	t

San Martín's parents moved from Argentina to their homeland in Spain when San Martín was a young boy, where he was educated and trained as an army officer. San Martín said he switched allegiance to fight the Spanish <i>for</i> Argentina as a calling of his native land.\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his success in Argentina, San Martín took on his greatest physical battle. He led an army over a nearly 15,000-foot pass in the Andes to surprise the Spanish in the Battle of Chacabuco near Santiago, Chile, where he was victorious. A Second battle months later won Chile's independence. Focused, San Martín pressed on toward Lima, Peru, where he would eventually lead another revolution. <br>\r\nThe decision to enroll slaves was a distinguishing mark of the early republic. General José de San Martín, who heavily recruited slaves in the western provinces, proclaimed to his troops before they marches on to liberate Chile,  "Soldiers, six days ago you were slaves and now you are citizens." San Martín's largely black army defeated the royalist forces in Chile.\r\n</p>	large	f

Jefferson advised President Madison to offer Napoleon a free hand in Spanish America in return for the gift of Cuba to the United States. The US should not go to war for Cuba, he wrote to President Monroe in 1823, &quot;but the first war on other accounts will give it to us, or the Island will give itself to us, when able to do so.&quot; \r\n<br>\r\nIn a letter to Minister to Spain Hugh Nelson, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams describes the likelihood\r\nof US &quot;annexation of Cuba&quot; within half a century despite\r\nobstacles: &quot;But there are laws of political as well as of physical\r\ngravitation; and if an apple severed by the tempest from its\r\nnative tree cannot choose but fall to the ground, Cuba, forcibly\r\ndisjoined from its own unnatural connection with Spain, and incapable of self support, can gravitate only towards the NorthAmerican Union, which by the same law of nature cannot cast her off from its bosom.&quot; \r\n<br>\r\n\r\nSecretary of State Adams described Cuba as &quot;an object of transcendent importance to the commercial and political interests of our Union.&quot; Like Jefferson, Adams urged Spanish sovereignty until Cuba would fall into US hands by &quot;the laws of political...gravitation,&quot; a &quot;ripe fruit&quot; for harvest. Support for Spanish rule was near universal in the Executive branch and Congress; European powers, Colombia, and Mexico were approached for assistance in the endeavor of blocking the liberation of Cuba. A prime concern was the democratic tendencies in the Cuban independence movement, which advocated abolition of slavery and equal rights for all. There was again a threat that &quot;the rot would spread,&quot; even to our own shores. <br>  \r\nCubans call this policy <i>la fruta madura</i> (ripe fruit); Washington would wait until the fruit is considered ripe for the picking.</p>	large	f

Both Liberals and Conservatives accrue huge landholdings, displacing indigenous owners, and many Indigenous people are forced into virtual slavery. <br>\r\nA strong regionalist sentiment continued to characterize these groups and would shape political conflict and patterns of Indian resistance in the nineteenth century. With the virtual absence of central authority, local military leaders who had supported the independence movement assumed control of their own areas of influence. None of these caudillos could maintain control of state government, and a period of political instability continued until the national liberal forces achieved supremacy over their conservative rivals at the end of the 1860s. Political rivalries were animated by the struggle for control over Indian land and labor. The Liberal forces viewed the highland elites, in particular the church, as the main obstacle to gain access to the large supply of labor in the indigenous villages. They also sought to wrest control of lowland estates and plantations from the Dominicans.\r\n</p>	large	f

A patrol of American\r\ntroops was sent into territory between the Nueces River and the Rio\r\nGrande River that the Mexicans claimed was their land. The patrol was\r\nwiped out by Mexican forces.

Similar to the Aponte Rebellion, which followed a rapid increase in Cuban sugar production, Demeraran plantation owners switched from cotton to sugar to capitalize on the economic opening in the world market produced by the Haitian Revolution. The twenty-five-mile east coast of Demerara was home to some of the most exploitative sugar plantations in the New World. At the time of the insurrection in 1823, the slave population numbered 77,000, while the white population numbered only 2,500. Africans represented 54 percent of the slave population, drawn predominantly from Gold Coast Akan-speakers collectively identified as Coromantees. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the enslaved Creoles made up 46 percent of this population. As a concession to British abolitionists, masters allowed missionaries to minister to the slaves. Similar to how Aponte and his followers crafted their own ideology of liberation from disparate sources that resonated with their local and Atlantic backgrounds, Demeraran slaves appropriated the missionaries’ evangelical language and symbols and turned Sunday church services, which brought enslaved laborers together from various plantations, into organizational opportunities for the rebellion.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="3"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="position:relative;top:-44px;">\r\n&emsp;When the rebellion broke out in August 1823, in a matter of weeks the slave army numbered 10,000 to 12,000 and controlled nearly sixty plantations. Comparable to the Aponte Rebellion, Demeraran slaves believed the king and British Parliament had granted them various rights that local officials had usurped. When the colonial governor asked why the slaves revolted, in an attempt to end the rebellion through negotiation, they boldly demanded "Our rights." The governor recognized how the slaves had wed the radical beliefs of Christianity, emphasizing equality of all men before God, with abolition rumors. The slaves told the governor that "God had made them of the same flesh and blood as the whites; they were tired of being slaves; their good King has sent orders that they should be free, and they would not work any more."\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n After making it clear that they would not return to slavery, the British colonial state brought to bear its full military force and violently subdued the insurgents. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nSeveral of the leaders were decapitated after their executions and had their heads places stuck up on posts within the military fort.\r\n</p>	large	f

Abolition of slavery had been debated in London in 1831, and white slavers in Jamaica had spent much of the year loudly protesting the proposed measures. This island-wide movement of reaction spread the news to the slaves. Sharpe and other preachers began discussing Thomas Paine in their chapels. With the demand of emancipation and normalized wages, Sharpe led a strike that became a revolt, damaging property, but killing only fourteen whites. Over five hundred Blacks were massacred in response, and Black chapels were burned to the ground. Emancipation was won by the end of the decade.\r\n<br>\r\nSharpe, today, is an official national hero of Jamaica.

164	The Bugles Sounded The Attack	1832	1832	uru1	ind	Open Veins of Latin America	<p class="entry columns">The massacres of Indians that began with Columbus never stopped. In Uruguay and Argentine Patagonia they were exterminated during the last century by troops that hunted them down and penned them in forests or in the desert so that they might not disturb the organized advance of cattle latifundia. The last of the Charruas,<i> pictured</i>, who lived by raising bulls in the wild pampas of northern Uruguay, were betrayed in 1832 by President Jose Fructuoso Rivera. Removed from the bush that gave them protection, deprived of horses and arms by false promises of friendship, they were overwhelmed at a place called Boca del Tigre. &quot;<i>The bugles sounded the attack</i>,&quot; wrote Eduardo Acevedo Diaz in La Epoca (August 19, 1890). &quot;<i>The horde churned about desperately, one after the other of its young braves falling like bulls pierced in the neck</i>.&quot; Many chiefs were killed. The few Indians who could break through the circle of fire took vengeance soon afterward. Pursued by Rivera's brother, they laid an ambush and riddled him and his soldiers with spears. The chief Sepe &quot;<i>had the tip of his spear adorned with some tendons from the corpse.</i>&quot; <br>In Argentine, Patagonia soldiers drew pay for each pair of testicles they brought in. </p>	large	f

167	Cabanagem	1835	1840	bra5	redstar	Colonization As Exploitation in the Amazon Rain Forest, 1758-1911 By Robin Leslie Anderson	<p class="entry columns">\r\nFor half a century after the abolition of the Directorate in 1798, neither Portugal nor Brazil had an effective settlement policy for the Amazon Basin. Shortly before Brazil's political independence in 1822, the Belem elite began a heady orgy of political temper tantrums, pitting Portuguese against Creole in petty politicking that eventually broke into the open warfare known as the Cabanagem revolt. The political rhetoric and vitriol did not reflect fundamental social or economic differences between the participants but simply questions of political method and the spoils of office. However, by engaging numbers of the semifree peasants and detribalized Indians of the region (known as <i>caboclos</i>), workers, and marginal small farmers to do the physical fighting, the elite foretold their own destruction. In 1835, when the lower class eventually rose in rebellion against the men they perceived as authority figures, a good many individuals of the ruling class died violent deaths.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nMost of the fighting and destruction during the Cabanagem took place in and around Selem, but outbreaks of violence occurred all over the basin. It was a localized rebellion over local issues, with limited ideological scope that spread over an immense territory. It was not a revolt with a clear agenda or purpose, but the violence was often a matter of personal grudges and vendettas. The caboclos struck out against those individuals whom they saw as having wealth and power over them, most often being those of European ancestry. Although not clearly defined enough to be called race and class warfare, the Cabanagem was definitely a war between the haves and have-nots. The elite class suffered serious losses, as many died during the shelling of Belem or disappeared after fleeing the city.\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/caboclos1912.jpg"  class="floatright" style="max-width:68%">\r\nWhen most of the fighting had ended by 1836, the survivors from the elite class slowly reestablished their economic control of the basin. In time, they would again guide the reins of economic growth, but they remained extremely cautious about their relationship with the caboclos. As the issue of colonization and settlement of new areas became a major topic of debate, the residual fear of the violent potential of the caboclos may well have been one reason for the decision to bring foreign immigrants rather than resettle and subsidize the native paraenses. The elites had no intention of allowing the caboclos any opportunity for advancement.\r\n</p>\r\n<i>Pictured, Caboclos circa 1912</i>\r\n\r\n<!-- The Nineteenth-Century Context of Immigration and Colonization --><br>	large	f
168	The War of Tatters	1835	1845	bra4	power	THE CAMBRIDGE HISTORY OF LATIN AMERICA	<img src="/mapimages/wartattersragamuffinarmy.jpg"><img src="/mapimages/wartattersragamuffinarmy.jpg">\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\nThe second rebellion, chronologically, was quite different in nature. It became known as the Farroupilha, a name used to characterize the radicals after the abdication of Pedro I, and took place in the southern province of Rio Grande do Sul. The province had over 100,000 inhabitants, and the capital, Porto Alegre, had, in 1830, a population of between 12,000 and 15,000. As in Para, slaves composed more or less 30 per cent of the total population. But Rio Grande do Sul had a very different social structure from the rest of Brazil. The historical circumstances of the formation of the province had led to a fusion of military status and landownership, and the militarized dominant class exercised almost total control over the subordinate groups in society. Moreover, the province had gone through an important economic transformation in the second decade of the century, moving from agriculture to livestock production. A charque industry also developed along the coast. The occupation of the Banda Oriental in 1817 had given a tremendous boost to the estancieiros. They not only bought land in what became the Cisplatine Province but also transferred vast numbers of cattle to Brazil. The loss of the Banda Oriental in 1828 had been a severe blow, although it did not stop the regular smuggling of cattle across the frontier. In fact, economic and political relations among the estancieiros of Rio Grande do Sul, Uruguay and the Argentine provinces of Entre Rios and Corrientes were an important factor in the rebellion of 1835. They formed a powerful group of caudillos in search of a political organization that could best suit their interests.\r\n<br>\r\nThe beginning of the revolt was not very different from that of the Cabanagem, in the sense that it turned around the reaction of local liberals against the formation of the caramuru Sociedade Militar in 1833 and against a president appointed by the regency. The president, who suspected secessionist plans among the local leaders, was overthrown in September 1835. Under the next president, himself a rich estancieiro, factions coalesced and in February 1836 open war broke out. In September 1836 the farroupilhas proclaimed the independence of the province under a republican government, although they were not able to keep control of the capital.In 1839, with the help  of a small naval task force organized by the Italian revolutionary, Giuseppe Garibaldi, they invaded the neighbouring province of Santa Catarina, where a shortlived republic was also proclaimed. The fight dragged on for ten years until an armistice was agreed in March 1845.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f

Some US citizens conspire with a new secret\r\norganization of pro-annexation Cubans, the Club de La Habana, founded by Miguel de Aldama, <i>Pictured</i>.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n&emsp;Miguel de Aldama typified those wealthy Creoles of Cuba who, fearing slave revolts, had become annexationists, advocates of the island's acquisition by the United States. Fears that Spain—which seemed weaker with each passing year—might eventually yield to pressures from British abolitionists and free the island's slaves nourished a growing conviction that only membership in the republican union to the north could rescue the island from a rising tide of social, economic, and political troubles. Such fears increased dramatically in 1843 when rumors of a massive slave uprising planned for Christmas Day swept the island. Whether or not the revolt, alleged to have been encouraged by the British abolitionist David Turnbull, was ever more  than a rumor, reaction to it was swift and brutal. Captain General Leopold O'Donnell, the island's chief colonial official, had been appointed to his post that autumn to end a rash of slave revolts that had already darkened the decade. In the weeks after Christmas, all of those accused of involvement in the alleged conspiracy were strapped to a ladder (<i>escalera</i>), beaten, then executed.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;In the wake of what became known as La Escalera conspiracy, more and more of Cuba's wealthy Creoles became annexationists. Creole pride might have preferred outright independence, but fears of inadvertently igniting a slave revolt were stronger. The United States seemed the best alternative to royalist Spain: an option that promised relative autonomy, a likely end to the slave trade, but immediate protection of Cuban slavery—and all without massive social upheaval.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;While reciprocal calls from the United States for Cuba's annexation had been raised since at least 1806, the two movements usually operated without coordination and, not infrequently, at cross purposes. By the mid-1840s, however, a marriage of the two Cuban annexationist movements—one in the United States, the other in Cuba—had become inevitable.\r\n<img src="/mapimages/cuba1947aldama.gif" class="floatright">\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f
183	The Caste War of the Yucatan	1847	1901	mex2	ind	THE CAMBRIDGE HISTORY OF LATIN AMERICA Vols. 4 and 5	<p class="entry columns3">\r\nSpecial conditions prevailed in Yucatan. The local <i>hacendados</i> were successfully growing <i>henequen</i>—sisal, a fibre-producing agave—for export and had few ties with central Mexico. Quite naturally, Yucatan embraced federalism and in 1839 rebelled against Mexico with the help of Mayan soldiers, becoming for all practical purposes an independent state. In 1840, the American traveller, John L. Stephens, found the Indian peons submissive and humble. Two years later, after his second visit, he warned:\r\n<i><font style="color:#cc0000;">\r\nWhat the consequences may be of finding themselves, after ages of servitude, once more in the possession of arms and in increasing knowledge of their physical strength is a question of momentous import to the people of that country, the solution of which no man can foretell.</font>\r\n<br>\r\n</i>\r\nStephen's forebodings were borne out five years later. In return for the service of Indian peasants as soldiers, the whites had promised to abolish or at least reduce parochial fees, to abolish the capitation tax payable by all Indian adults, and to give them free use of public and communal lands. None of these promises were fulfilled and the Mayas rebelled in the summer of 1847 with the aim of exterminating or at least expelling the white population. The revolt soon developed into full-scale war, known ever since as the War of the Castes. Mexico had just been defeated by the United States and, even had it wished to do so, was unable to send an army to Yucatan to suppress the revolt. In the cruel war which followed, the Indians almost succeeded in driving their enemies into the sea. In their despair, the whites went as far as to offer Yucatan to Great Britain, the United States, or, indeed, any country willing to protect them.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/castewaryucatan.jpg" style="width:100%;column-span: all;COLSPAN=2;">\r\n\r\n<br>  \r\nWhile Yucatan was in the throes of this race war, Indian tribes, forced southward by the expansion of the United States, invaded the sparsely populated regions of northern Mexico, burning haciendas, villages and mining settlements, and indiscriminately killing their inhabitants. Again, the Mexican government was too weak to prevent these incursions.\r\n<br>  \r\nSocial and ethnic revolt took a different form in central Mexico. Here the Indians did not form a compact, linguistic group and nor were they in a clear majority, as were the Mayas in Yucatan. However, deserters from the army, fugitives from justice, vagrants and similar elements, taking advantage of Mexico's military defeat and the chaos which followed, formed armed bands which began to terrorize the countryside. In at least one district, in the mountains of the states of Guanajuato, Queretaro and San Luis Potosi, a revolutionary agrarian movement developed. This so- called Sierra Gorda rebellion sought to give free land to hacienda tenants and peons, but the rebels were not strong enough to attack cities, and they had to be satisfied with the burning of haciendas. The Mexican ruling class, demoralized, embittered and divided, watched helplessly as the remnants of their once great country were beginning to fall apart.\r\n<br>  \r\nFollowing the caste wars of 1847—55 they managed to set up an independent state in southern Yucatan and until 1901 resisted numerous attempts by federal troops to re-establish Mexican sovereignty. Moreover, armed with weapons they purchased in neighbouring British Honduras, they frequently ventured out to raid adjacent Mexican territories with relative impunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f

A band of about 300 adventurers, mainly negroes from Jamaica, had occupied the port of San Juan del Norte, and began to commit depredations upon an adjacent settlement of Americans known as Punta Arenas. Finally they organised a strong force to demolish tho little colony at Punta Arenas, but their design was defeated by \r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/nicaragua1854.jpg" class="floatright">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe interposition of an American warship which happened to be in the harbor. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn May of 1854 matters were further complicated by the attempt of a body of men from Greytown to arrest in Punta Arenas the captain of one of the boats of the Accessory Transit Company of Nicaragua on a charge of murder. Solon Borland, the American minister to powers, Central Ammica, happened to be present on this occasion, and, believing that the captain of the steamboat was innocent and that the intruding party had no jurisdiction, interposed effectually to prevent violence and bloodshed. Borland afterward visited Grey town and, while there, was subjected to insult by a mob. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn receiving offical accounts of these occurences, the sloop of war <i>Cyane</i> was sent to enforce the demands of the American government—that the people of Greytown make reparation for injuries to our citizens and due-apology for their insult to Borland. But the Greytown people evinced no disposition to comply, so on July 9, 1854, after 24 hours' notice had been given, the <i>Cyane</i> opened fire on the town. Before much injury had been done the <i>Cyane</i> suspended fire in order to afford opportunity of complying with the demands which had been made. As nothing was heard from the town authorities, however, the <i>Cyane</i> continued the bombardment until the town was laid in ashes. No lives were lost and most of the buildings destroyed were of little value.&quot;This transaction,&quot; said the President, &quot;has been the subject of complaint on the part of some foreign powers and has been characterized with more of harshness than of justice.&quot; (From <i>The United States: its beginnings, progress and modern development, Volume 7</i> by Jesse Ames Spencer; 1913)\r\n\r\n</p><p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n<strong>What was the insult?</strong><br>\r\nBorland was held captive after going ashore and threatened\r\nwith arrest by the Jamaicans, but after being held 48 hours was not, due\r\nto his diplomatic immunity. While arguing with local Jamaican officials,\r\nsomeone threw a bottle in his face leaving a scar on his forehead. This incident,\r\n along with the continuing activities against the Vanderbilt\r\noperation were reported to the Pierce administration by Borland on\r\nreturn to Washington city, who then dispatched an American naval ship to\r\nthe area demanding them to apologize to the minister and to stop\r\nillegal harassment of and confiscation of property, correct other\r\nillegal activities against the Vanderbilt interests, and to make\r\nreparation or restitution for property stolen from American citizens.\r\nAfter a warning, with nothing forthcoming, the American ship and marines\r\nbombarded and burned the unoccupied British city Greytown.\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f

US occupies isthmus to quell disturbances.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/1856watermelonwar-small.jpg" style="position:relative;float:right;right:-10px;top:-17px;">\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="background-color:white; padding:7px;width:580px;position:relative;top:-290px;">\r\nFew Panamanians benefited from the construction of the Panama railroad service running from Aspinwall/Colon to Panama City (and an accompanying steam lighter service in Panama Bay). The railroad's completion was a success for its U.S. investors, in spite of the competition offered by a contemporary transit route across Nicaragua, operated by Cornelius Vanderbilt. It was also valuable to Panama's economy, since cash flow grew exponentially and many wealthy foreign businessmen set up shop in Panama City. However, the benefits were far fewer for common Panamanians. Thousands of local workers were left unemployed, disgruntled, and angry both at the American company and at the growing American control of the entire zone surrounding the railroad. The American community had grown quickly and become a contending economic and cultural force. Panamanians began to feel like foreigners in their own land. Americans also brought with them virulent racism common at the time in the United States, insensitivity toward Panamanian culture, and a sense of superiority that bordered on megalomania. The dollar and English displaced the peso and Spanish, and the first major newspaper to be published in Panama was the English language <i>Panama Star and Herald</i>. Its publisher, Archibald Boyd, was an American immigrant to Panama, and his son, Federico Boyd, became one of the ten founders of independent Panama and briefly held the presidency in 1910.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nAmong the droves of Americans crossing Panama were many unsavory types who, according to contemporary accounts, were little more than criminals. All too often, they passed their time drunk while waiting for ships and frequently showed their contempt for Panama's mixed races. One such traveler, an American named Jack Oliver, ignited the so-called "Watermelon War" in 1856. The famous incident, on April 15, 1856, laid bare the tensions, fears, and anger Panamanians experienced due to economic adjustments and foreign presence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="The Aftermath"></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="background-color:white; padding:7px;">\r\nWhen the American refused to pay for a slice of watermelon and the poor black vendor protested, the traveler produced a pistol, causing Panamanians to respond in kind. The scuffle soon degenerated into a brawl between the Americans and Panamanians, many of whom were Afro-Panamanian. Within a few hours, U.S.-owned businesses in the area lay in shambles and Americans had taken refuge in the train station. The Panamanian police arrived on the scene and, after being shot at from the train station, attacked and eventually overran it. The mob destroyed the station, tore up track, cut telegraph wires, and terrorized the Americans, who were finally escorted aboard a steam tender and taken off shore. The fatalities included fifteen Americans and two Panamanians, with dozens injured.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nA report sent to Washington detailing the incident recommended a military occupation of the isthmus, based on the "colored population's hatred of Americans" and the Colombian government's "inability to maintain order." Coupled with derogatory newspaper reports of Panamanians' shiftlessness, including an uncomplimentary article printed in the Chicago Republican by a young Samuel Clemens, public opinion toward Panama in the United States was tilted toward military intervention. Six months later, U.S. soldiers landed in Panama City and briefly took control of the railroad station. The United States justified the intervention through the Monroe Doctrine and the <a data-entry="181" data-year="1846">Bidlack-Mallarino</a> treaty with Colombia, in which the United States had pledged to keep Panama open to free transit. Adding insult to injury, Colombia was forced to pay $412,000 in restitution to the railroad for damages, further embittering public opinion in Panama toward the United States.\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first U.S. military intervention in Panama. Thirteen more would occur before Panama's independence from Colombia 47 years later. The Watermelon War underscored two recurring themes of the next fifty years: the frequency with which the United States would use force to protect its economic interest in Panama, and the way in which American cultural and racial beliefs of the time would be implanted in the isthmus. Despite British protests under the terms of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, Panama had become a protectorate of the United States. The issue of sovereignty in the transit zone would come to define Panamanians' sense of nationalism, the country's economic system, and its geopolitical future. The railroad's utility as a vital link between the two U.S. coasts had become patently clear, and the strategic value of the isthmus became imbedded in the minds of U.S. policymakers, an idea that would endure for almost a century and a half.\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f
197	The War of Reform (1857 - 61)	1857	1861	mex3	power		<p class="entry columns"> \r\nThe reforms embodied in the Mexican constitution of 1857 were supported by the liberals and opposed by\r\nthe conservatives. Mexico's liberal president, Ignacio Comonfort (1812-63), was forced into\r\nexile by conservative general Félix Zuloaga (1814-76), who took control of the capital,\r\nMexico City, and assumed presidential powers in early 1858, until he was replaced by Miguel\r\nMirarnon (1832-67), a conservative. A rump congress met in Querétaro and proclaimed\r\nBenito Juarez (1806-72), a liberal, president in 1858. \r\n<br>\r\nIn Mexico City, the conservatives controlled the regular army and were supported by the church and the wealthy. The government of\r\nthe liberals, who had a poorly equipped militia, was forced to flee from Querétaro to Guadalajara, from there to the Pacific coast and then to Panama. Finally, it made its capital the Mexican port of Veracruz on May 4, 1858. The United States recognized the Mexican government there in\r\n1859 and gave arms to the liberals. The liberal army under Santos Degollado (d. 1861) fought in the west but lost every major battle, including notable defeats at Tacubaya (April 11, 1859) and Celaya (November 1859). Miramon and his forces attempted to drive Juarez out of Veracruz\r\nin early 1859, but many of his men sickened and died in the lowland. \r\n<br>\r\nDegollado marched on Mexico City but suffered defeat at Chapultepec in April 1859. Desperately needing money, Juérez's government confiscated church property and thus was able to better arm and equip its armies. Jesus Gonzalez Ortega (1824-81) led liberal troops to victory near Guadalajara and afterward at Calderon (1860). Ortega's decisive defeat of Miramon's forces at the Battle of Calpulalpam on December 20, 1860, opened the way\r\nto Mexico City, which Juarez entered on January 1, 1861; he then assumed full control of the country and put into effect the reforms in the constitution.\r\n</p><p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:80%;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n\r\n<strong style="color:#cc0000"> Abraham and Benito</strong><br>\r\nA Juarez-led liberal coalition triumphed over conservatives attempting to defend the privileges of the Church. The latter were particularly enraged by the Ley Juarez (the Juarez Law), legislation that restructured the judicial system to limit the authority of military and ecclesiastical courts, and by the liberal constitution of 1857.\r\n<br>\r\nThough Abrahama Lincoln and Juarez never met personally, they formed a lifetime, long-distance mutual admiration society. Lincoln's attitude toward Juarez was no doubt shaped by the friendly feeling he perennially entertained toward Mexico. Lincoln strongly opposed the U.S.-Mexican War of 1846-1848, characterizing it as &quot;a war of conquest brought into existence to catch votes,&quot; and adding that, &quot;Mexico was in no way molesting or menacing the U.S.&quot;\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it is not known exactly when Juarez came to Lincoln's attention, we do know that Lincoln was a strong Juarez supporter by 1857, eve of the Reform War. When Juarez was temporarily driven out of Mexico City by the conservatives, Lincoln sent him a message expressing hope &quot;for the liberty of . . . your government and its people.&quot;\r\n<br>\r\nThe bond between the two leaders was greatly strengthened during the American Civil War. In 1861, the year the Civil War began, Juarez was elected president of Mexico. The Reform War had bankrupted Mexico's treasury and Juarez suspended debt payments to Mexico's chief European creditors, France, Britain and Spain. The European powers organized a punitive expedition, seizing Veracruz. But Britain and Spain pulled out when they learned of Napoleon III's desire to install a puppet government in Mexico City. The French, defeated at Puebla in 1862, poured in reinforcements and captured Mexico City in 1863. Fleeing the capital, Juarez organized resistance in the north.\r\n<br>\r\nThough Lincoln obviously had his hands full during the Civil War, he still did what he could to help Juarez. Union General Phil Sheridan wrote in his journal that, &quot;we continued covertly supplying arms and munitions to the liberals, sending as many as 30,000 muskets from the Baton Rouge alone.&quot; To Sheridan came this order from General Grant, which of course originated from Lincoln: &quot;Concentrate at all available points in the States an army strong enough to move against the invaders of Mexico... &quot;\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/benitolincoln.jpg" class="floatleft">Illustrative of how Juarez reciprocated Lincoln's friendly attitude was his response to an ill-advised overture he received from the Confederate government. The South had sent a delegation, under John T. Pickett, to try and win over the juaristas. Juarez, to put it mildly, sent the Confederates a message&#8212;throwing Pickett into a Mexico City jail for thirty days and then expelling him from the country.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<i>Photo Illustration of Lincoln and Juarez combined</i>\r\n</p>	large	f

These idyllic proceedings are the chief momenta of primitive accumulation.&quot;</i></font><br>\r\nPlunder, internal and external, was the most important means of primitive accumulation of capital, an accumulation which, after the Middle Ages, made possible a new historical stage in world economic evolution. As the money economy extended, more and more social strata and regions of the world became involved in unequal exchange. Ernest Mandel has added up the value of the gold and silver torn from Latin America up to 1660, the booty extracted from Indonesia by the Dutch East India Company from 1650 to 1780, the harvest reaped by French capital in the eighteenth-century slave trade, the profits from slave labor in the  British Antilles and from\r\na half-century of British looting in India. The total exceeds the capital invested in all European industrial enterprises operated by steam in about 1800. This enormous mass of capital, Mandel notes, created a favorable climate for investment in Europe, stimulated the &quot;spirit of enterprise,&quot; and directly financed the establishment of manufactures, which in turn gave a strong thrust to the Industrial Revolution. <br>\r\nBut at the same time the formidable international concentration of wealth for Europe's benefit prevented the jump into the accumulation of industrial capital in the plundered areas: “The double tragedy of the developing countries consists in the fact that they were not only victims of that process of international concentration, but that subsequently they have had to try and compensate for their industrial backwardness—that is, realize the primitive accumulation of industrial capital—in a world flooded with articles manufactured by an already mature industry, that of the West.”</p>\r\n<p style="font-size:80%; font-style:italic;">11th–16th century Chiriqui Gold Pendant, NYC's Metropolitan Museum of Art, gift of Alice K.

Over time, the Indian society lost its military coloration as Moravian missionaries from Bethlehem, PA, and American and British companies like Standard Fruit moved into the area. Along with the foreign companies and the missionaries came small businessmen-many of them Britons, Germans, and Americans-who settled in the interior of the Rio Coco. They settled into the region, married Indian women, and set up trading posts, ranches, boat yards, and lumber supply areas along the river. These people, called &quot;bamboo whites&quot; by the Marines, shipped raw wood from inside Nicaragua to sawmills located at Puerto Cabezas on the coast. Both politically and economically, they would prove critical in the war with Sandino.\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result of all these developments-missionary activity, the development of foreign owned &quot;big businesses&quot; along the coast, and the addition of a new strata of &quot;bamboo businessmen&quot; to the area's social structure-the Miskito remained more connected to the United States and the English-speaking Caribbean than to Hispanic Nicaragua. But if local history and economics pushed the coast in one direction, geopolitics moved it in another. Backed by pressure from the United States, Great Britain dropped the coast from protectorate status and officially ceded the area to Nicaragua in 1860. Since Nicaragua was too weak to exercise its claim, the coast remained in political limbo for decades until Nicaraguan President Jose Santos Zelaya sent troops into the area to capture Bluefields in 1894.\r\n<br>\r\nDespite military occupation by Spanish-speaking troops, the Indians continued to resent the Nicaraguans. The inhabitants of the coast also kept looking to Great Britain for support (several British and American businessmen did sell them arms).  In 1894, the Miskito Reserve was dissolved — &quot;reincorporated&quot; into the Nicaraguan state — which led to a local uprising that was eventually quelled by the US Marines. \r\n<br>\r\nIn the years following the 1894 takeover, Black Creoles and Miskito Indians would pepper the British Foreign Office with petitions that asked the British to retake their territory, a tradition that would continue until the late 1950s. This fraught relationship with the Nicaraguan government would lead to troubles well into the 1980s.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f

Marti, who had spent many years raising funds and support from Cuban and leftist communities in the United States and Spain, is killed on May 19th of 1895. By 1898, the revolutionaries controlled half the island despite the 200,000 Spanish troops sent against them. That year, the US sent the warship USS Maine to Havana. Its explosion, which killed 258 troops aboard, remains a mystery to this day, but was used as grounds by President William McKinley to attack. US troops were sent to other Spanish colonies, including Puerto Rico and the Philippines where their own wars of independence were under way. The United States took both of the latter countries as colonies, killing hundreds of thousands of local rebels in the ensuing years, and in December of 1898, took it upon itself to sign the Treaty of Paris with Spain which recognized Cuban independence. Of course, no Cuban was involved in the signing. </p>	large	f

At the end of the month they began to publish the newspaper <i>Prevision</i>.\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="../mapimages/Partido_de_Color_de_Cuba.png" style="padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;">\r\n<span class="caption"> Members of the Movement</span>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir goal was to advocate for Afro-Cuban integration into mainstream society with equal participation in government. Their platform demanded an end to racial discrimination, equal access to education and government jobs by Afro-Cubans and an end to the ban on &quot;non-white&quot; immigration. Additional demands tried to improve the conditions of all Cubans: the expansion of compulsory free education from 8 to 14 years, abolition of the death penalty, establishment of an 8-hr work day and priority for Cubans in employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n&quot;Our motto is 'Cuba for the Cubans,'&quot; said an editorial in <i>Prevision</i> on September 15 1908.\r\n<br>\r\nIn May 1909, while serving as President of the Cuban Senate, Morua Delgado introduced a law in the senate that banned political parties based on race or class. This was a direct attack on the Partido Independiente de Color, and was known as the Morua Law.\r\n<br>\r\nThree years later a demonstration sponsored by the Independientes grew into demonstrations in which Afro-Cubans attacked and burned foreign-owned properties.  In May of 1912, PIC organizers launched an armed demonstration seeking legalization in time for November's elections.  Government forces, fearing an all-out &quot;race war&quot; and hoping to rid it of a prominent political adversary, subsequently launched an armed campaign against the party, massacring an estimated 6,000 Afro-Cubans.  Among the dead included party leaders, rank-and-file members, and ordinary Afro-Cuban peasants who had no ties to the PIC. \r\nDuring the uprising, US Marines land and two US battleships anchor in Havana harbor but the Taft administration maintains this does not constitute intervention.\r\n<br>\r\nThe assault resulted in the final demise of the party and a warning to black Cubans who sought to challenge the structure of power established and maintained by white Cuba. &quot;The movement was crushed immediately everywhere except in Oriente, especially Guantanamo region,&quot; wrote Hugh Thomas in <i>Cuba, or The Pursuit of Freedom</i>. &quot;The alarm was nevertheless immense, Havana being overwhelmed by panic.

In\r\n1896 marines attacked Corimo to 'protect American interests during\r\npolitical unrest'; in 1898 US troops landed at San Juan del Sur; in 1899\r\nthey were in action in Bluefields and San Juan del Norte, all under the\r\nrubric of 'protecting American lives and bridges'. Nicaraguans should\r\nhave understood by this time that people in Washington, not Managua,\r\nwould control their destiny.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/josesantoszelaya.jpg" class="floatleft">\r\n\r\nNevertheless, some Nicaraguans took sovereignty seriously. In the\r\nearly 1900s Nicaraguan President Jose Samos Zelaya (who assumed\r\ndictatorial powers) committed a bold and, as it turned out, rather\r\nimprudent act. \r\nThis crusty authoritarian nationalist refused to cede to\r\nthe United States exclusive rights to build a canal, which would have\r\nincluded US control of a strip of Nicaraguan territory. Instead, he invited\r\nEuropean and Japanese concerns to aid in building an interoceanic link\r\nto connect the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. He also asked the Bank of\r\nEngland - not a New York bank - for a loan.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\nUS Secretary of State Philander C. Knox took umbrage. Highly\r\nconscious of the Monroe Doctrine and the Roosevelt Corrolary to\r\nthat document, which asserted US 'international police power' in the\r\nhemisphere, Knox branded Zelaya's moves as opening the door to\r\n'European infiltration'. He angrily denounced the Nicaraguan president\r\nfor even daring to think about entering into financial transactions with\r\nany but US banks. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKnox's subsequent demands on the Nicaraguan\r\ngovernment belied even the thinnest respect for its sovereignty: a ninety-nine\r\nyear lease for a naval base on the Gulf of Fonseca and permanent\r\naccess rights for a canal through Nicaragua. In words that presaged\r\nReagan administration rhetoric some seventy years later, Philander Knox,\r\nin 1909, accused Zelaya of '<i>keeping Central America in tension and\r\nturmoil</i>'.\r\n<br>\r\nThe stubborn Zelaya, taking seriously the fiction of Nicaraguan\r\nindependence, refused to accede to Knox's commands. The US government retaliated by destabilizing his regime. During the course of\r\nsubverting Zelaya's government, two US secret agents were caught <i>in\r\nflagrante delicto</i> trying to dynamite Nicaraguan bridges. Zelaya ordered\r\nthem to be tried. Despite US protestations, they were convicted and\r\nshot. Knox used the incident to sever diplomatic relations and send\r\nmarines to Bluefields.\r\n<br>\r\nKnox's plan worked. As was the case in subsequent episodes of\r\ndestablization, the government and the private sector cooperated. United\r\nFruit Company donated $1 million toward the overthrow of the Zelaya\r\ngovernment. \r\n\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/philandercknox.jpg" class="floatright">\r\n\r\nZelaya was forced into exile and replaced by Adolfo Diaz\r\nwho, obedient to Washington's commands, canceled concessions to\r\nnon-US firms and opened the door to the exaggerated claims of US\r\nbanks, which then transferred to their own coffers more than half of\r\nNicaragua's national bank assets. In 1914, as the Panama Canal opened\r\nto ships crossing between the Atlantic and Pacific, President Diaz made\r\nan offer to the United States: S3 million in exchange for 'rights in\r\nperpetuity' to any land needed to build a canal through the San Juan\r\nroute in southern Nicaragua. The $3 million was handled by US-appointed\r\ncommissioners to repay foreign loans, mostly to US banks,\r\nso that a mere pittance actually found its way into the Nicaraguan\r\nTreasury. The canal was never built, but the United States acquired a\r\nrenewable lease for a naval base on the Corn Islands and on the Gulf\r\nof Fonseca.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<span class="caption">President Zelaya, <I>pictured with moustache</i>; Secretary of State Philander C.

241	The 20-year occupation fighting guerrillas of Augusto Sandino	1912	1933	innic1	redfist	Empire's Workshop, Greg Grandin	<p class="entry columns">\r\nThe Mexican Revolution taught American policy makers that Latin American economic nationalism was a force to be reckoned with. The hit-and-run guerrilla war tactics of Augusto Sandino, who between 1927 and 1933 fought the U.S. Marines in Nicaragua to a\r\ndraw, further taught them that political nationalism was an equally powerful force and that attempts to counter it with increased militarism would only lead to a deterioration of American influence. U.S. troops had been in and out of Nicaragua a number of times\r\nsince the late nineteenth century. In 1916 Calvin Coolidge, who despite his charisma deficit fancied himself a robust expansionist in the Theodore Roosevelt mold, once again dispatched an expedition, this time to quell a budding civil war but also to sequester the kind of revolutionary nationalism that was spreading throughout Mexico. His actions backfired.\r\n<br>\r\nDespite overwhelming asymmetrical firepower, including advances in aerial warfare, Nicaragua proved to be the United States's first third-world quagmire. Sandino harassed the Americans not just with attack-and-retreat guerrilla tactics that inflicted a deadly toll\r\nbut with ideas. As head of a self-styled Defending Army of Nicaraguan National Sovereignty, the rebel leader̵ who took as his official seal an image of a peasant with a raised machete about to decapitate a captured marine—tapped into widespread Latin American resentment. His brand of patriotism esteemed the dark-skinned, impoverished peasant culture that prevailed throughout Mesoamerica and much of South America, while vilifying not only Yankees but their well-heeled local allies, or, as Sandino called them, <i>vendepatrias</i>—country sellers. &quot;Pro-Nicaraguan committees&quot; sprang up throughout Latin America, with Sandino's David-against-Goliath struggle coming to embody a century of aggression and arrogance. Manifestos,  grassroots meetings, editorials, and ever larger street protests denounced Washington's war in Nicaragua. Newspapers published regular articles on the crisis and ran photographs provided by Sandino of captured, executed, and mutilated marines, contributing to a sense of U.S. vulnerability. His appeal extended to the United States, where he coordinned his public relations campaign with the activities of the All-American Anti-Imperialist League, sending his brother Socrates on a national speaking tour. In Europe, a Mexican delegate to the 1929 International Congress against Colonialism and Imperialism waved a tattered American flag captured by Sandino's troops to a loud round of cheers and applause. Even London, then in the process of spreading its control over much of the Middle East, took great pleasure re in condemning America's actions as &quot;frankly imperialistic.&quot;\r\n<br>\r\nTensions came to a head at the Sixth Pan-American Conference, held in Havana in early 1928. By the time of the meeting, pan-Americanism, the idea that the American republics shared common ideals and political interests, was in effect moribund. But it was trotted out every few years in an international forum where Latin American delegates mostly submitted to Washington's directives while silently seething about the latest violation of national sovereignty—in Panama, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Venezuela, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, take your pick. Proceedings in Havana moved according to script. The closing ceremony was not intended for debate, yet El Salvador raised the issue of Washington's military interventions, opening the floodgates of criticism. The gallery audience applauded each recounting of old and new grievances and hissed at the tepid defense of US. policy offered by its envoy. This court rebellion took place in the shadow of Sandino's war, which on the eve of the conference had scored a number of impressive victories. The rebel was not directly mentioned, although one Latin American daily after another read the diplomacy in light of the fighting in Nicaragua. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	large	t

244	National City Bank	1913	1913	arg1	economy	The Century of U.S. Capitalism in Latin America by thomas f. O' Brien	<p class="entry columns" style="padding-top:10px;"><i>National City Bank (now Citibank) opens its first South American branch, after having financed projects by US firms like General Electric there and elsewhere in the continent.</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General Electric Company operated in a new science based industry where technology played a critically important role. G.E. relied on protection of its patent rights to control markets and bar other entrants into the industry. These characteristics of the industry pushed G.E. into Latin America. When G.E. began to invest directly in overseas power generation, particularly in Latin America, it formed the <i>American and Foreign Power Company</i> (AFP) to manage those assets, During the 1920s, AFP expanded its operations to eleven Latin American countries, investing a  total of $500 million. As a result of these steps, G.E. could control markets and technologies in Latin America through its direct ownership of power generating companies in countries like Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, and Chile. Meanwhile, banks and investment firms became an inevitable part of this corporate thrust into Latin America.\r\n<br>\r\nHolding seats on many of the boards of these corporations and serving as critical sources of financing, firms such as J. P. Morgan and James Stillman's National City Bank soon became deeply involved in Latin America. Morgan and National City Bank provided financing for such corporations as American Smelting and Refining and General Electric. National City Bank also moved directly into South America by opening its first branch in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1913, followed by the establishment of branches in Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, and Cuba. U.S. financial institutions soon added to these activities by purchasing interest bearing bonds sold by Latin American governments as a means of generating loans. In fact, Morgan, National City, and other U.S. banking houses formed a South\r\nAmerican Group, sharing these loan offerings among themselves and British bankers. Of course, U.S. enterprise brought more than technology and capital to Latin America; their version of U.S. culture and the objective of spreading it far and wide in the Western Hemisphere were also an essential part of the package.\r\n<br>\r\nWhile an earlier generation of U.S. businesspeople had brought to Latin America a faith in their version of Protestantism and their republican form of government, this new generation of the entrepreneurial elite shared a grander vision and ambitions. Central to this vision "was the notion that the United States must assume the burdens of uplifting the Latin populace so that they could join in helping to fulfill the New World's unique destinies." The business elite grounded that idea in pseudoscientific racist philosophies. Those philosophies asserted that there were measurable physiological differences between humans, which created a hierarchy of superior and inferior races. Yet many U.S. business leaders who ascribed to these theories also believed that the citizens of civilized societies could reform and uplift the denizens of barbarian nations. In this manner, American racist beliefs defined Latin America as a series of backward, largely uncivilized societies, but capable of advancing to higher levels with U.S. assistance. U.S. business leaders would play perhaps the most important role in this new mission to reform and uplift the supposedly backward peoples of Latin America.<br>\r\n\r\nThe U.S. corporate mission of reform included a commitment to the reorganization of the work place-an essential aspect of the second industrial revolution. Such commitment meant training Latin American workers and middle class employees, not merely in specific skills, but in basic values of competitiveness, individualism, respect for professional qualifications, punctuality, and so forth. Yet this ambitious corporate program of Americanization in Latin American societies could not have advanced without the support of Latin American elites.\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f

Nor in Paraguay, as we have seen;\r\nbut the railroads built by the Paraguayan state, with the help of European\r\ntechnicians, passed into British hands after the defeat. The other countries'\r\nrailroads went the same way without producing a single centavo of new\r\ninvestment; furthermore, the state contracts took care to assure the companies a\r\nminimum profit level, to avoid possible unpleasant surprises. Decades later, at\r\nthe end of World War II, when the railroads yielded no more dividends and had\r\nfallen into relative disuse, the public authorities got them back. Almost all of\r\nthe states bought the scrap iron from the British and thus nationalized the\r\ncompanies' losses.\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the railroads were booming, the British concerns had often obtained\r\nconsiderable land concessions on either side of the tracks, in addition to the\r\nrailbeds themselves and the right to build new branch lines. The land was an\r\nadditional business bonanza. A fabulous gift to the Brazilian railway in 1911\r\nled to the burning of countless huts and the eviction or death of peasant\r\nfamilies in the concession area. It was this that triggered off the &quot;Contestado&quot;\r\nrevolt, one of the greatest outbursts of popular fury in Brazilian history.</i>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Contestado movement occurred in the south of the country in a\r\nfrontier area disputed by the states of Parana and Santa Catarina. It began\r\nin 1911 under the leadership of Jose Maria, who died in the first clashes\r\nand was heralded as a saint by the rebels of the Contestado. Unlike\r\nCanudos, the movement did not limit itself to one particular centre, but\r\nshifted to various points in the region, under pressure from military\r\nforces. The rebellion was put down in late 1915, when rebel strongholds\r\nwere attacked and destroyed by 6,000 soldiers from the army and the\r\npolice force, assisted by 1,000 civilians who joined in the process of\r\nrepression.\r\n<br>\r\nIn considering the principal social movements in the interior of Brazil\r\nduring the First Republic, Joazeiro, a city in the south of the state of\r\nCeara, which became the centre of activities of the priest Cicero Romao\r\nBatista between 1872 and 1924, also deserves mention. There are many\r\ncommon features between events in Joazeiro and the Canudos and\r\nContestado movements. For example, from the point of view of the\r\nhistory of the transformation of the Catholic church in Brazil, particularly\r\nin the north-east, Canudos and Joazeiro were manifestations of similar developments.\r\nOn the other hand, when considering social movements as\r\nmanifestations of rebellion, Joazeiro has little in common with the other\r\ntwo movements. Although Padre Cicero clashed continuously with the\r\necclesiastical authorities, and at times with factions of the oligarchy, his\r\nmovement for better or worse fell within the system of domination\r\nwhich prevailed during the First Republic. Put simply, the city of\r\nJoazeiro can be seen as an area controlled by a <i>priest-coronel</i>, who had a\r\nconsiderable degree of influence within the political oligarchy, particularly\r\nafter 1909 when Padre Cicero began to involve himself directly in\r\nthe political struggles.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="another page"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\nThe Canudos and Contestado movements were attempts to create an\r\nalternative way of life, and were considered sufficiently dangerous for\r\nboth to be brutally crushed by military forces. This does not mean that\r\nthey were totally opposed to the power structure of the coronets. Before\r\nsettling in Canudos, Antonio Conselheiro had been a practising member\r\nof the Catholic church, living an ascetic, nomadic life. He summoned\r\nthe people together in order to build or rebuild churches. He built\r\nwalls around cemeteries, and he showed concern for the small parish\r\nchurches of the interior. There is evidence that at this stage he was well\r\nlooked upon by certain coronets, for whom his disciplined followers built\r\nroads and dams. The village of Canudos itself did not depart very much\r\nfrom the traditional pattern of settlement in the interior. There was a\r\ncertain degree of social and economic differentiation, a considerable\r\ndegree of trade with the surrounding area, and religious links with the\r\npriests of the neighbouring parishes. Canudos was also a source of votes\r\nand influence at election time.\r\n<br>\r\nThe instigators of the Contesdado movement were the followers of a\r\ncoronet who was a member of the opposition and seen as a friend of the\r\npoor. Others of varying origins joined this group, among them those\r\nwho were the victims of the process of modernization in both urban and\r\nrural areas: rural workers driven off the land by the construction of a\r\nrailway and a timber plant, people who had been recruited for railway\r\nconstruction from among the unemployed of large cities and then\r\nabandoned at the end of their contract, and criminals who were at large in\r\nthe region. However, the village settlements which grew up during the\r\nContestado, with their emphasis on equality and fraternity, clashed with\r\nestablished social values, and assumed characteristics which were clearly\r\nmessianic. This can be seen, among other features, through the way\r\nmany of the members of the Contestado remained loyal to the monarchy\r\nwhich, it has been argued, represented an eschatological kingdom more\r\nthan a political institution. The theme of the monarchy, whether\r\nbecause of the form it took or because of the period in which the\r\nContestado movement occurred, was not exploited to any extent by the\r\ngovernment. In contrast, the earlier monarchism of Antonio\r\nConselheiro, with its attacks on the Republic, responsible for the\r\nintroduction of civil marriage and for the taking of cemeteries away from\r\nthe control of the church, took more concrete forms. As a result it was a\r\nmobilizing factor against Canudos in the urban centres, at a time when\r\nthe possibility of the restoration of the monarchy was seen as a real threat.\r\nCanudos, Contestado and Joazeiro were not episodes devoid of\r\nsignificance, nor were they isolated expressions by an ignorant rural\r\npopulation in contrast to the centres of civilization on the coast. In\r\ndifferent degrees, these movements can be linked to changes in the\r\nCatholic church, to socio-economic changes in their respective areas, and\r\nto the political development of the nation itself. Their particular strength\r\nas a demonstration of popular religious belief cannot be ignored.\r\nNevertheless, as attempts at independent organization on the part of the\r\nrural population, they effectively illustrate the severe limitations of such\r\norganization during the period of the First Republic.\r\n</p>	large	t

256	The Tragic Week and the Patagonian Tragedy	1921	1922	arg1	massacre	Argentina: What Went Wrong\n By Colin M. MacLachlan	<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:75%">The urban working class found little in common with the middle class.\nThey resented the economic privileges of factory owners, landholders,\nand exporters, as well as the Radical party's patronage of the middle\nclass. Strikes became more disruptive as industry attempted to deal with\nmaterial shortages caused by World War I. The war disrupted coal imports\nfrom England, forcing industry to operate at reduced levels. Railway\ncompanies struggled to maintain schedules while imports plunged. Real\nwages fell between 1914 and 1917 by a third as shortages forced industries\nto dismiss workers. Use of agricultural wastes compressed into briquettes\nfor heating and cooking symbolized wartime hardships and the decline\nin living standards. Frustrated workers clashed with factory owners\nas strikes became violent. Employers with links with vigilante groups\nformed the Labor Association (Asociacion del Trabajo) to break strikes with\nreplacement workers. The meatpacking strike of December 1917 ended\nbloodily, as the police stormed union headquarters armed with sabers\nslashing anyone unlucky enough to be in the way. A railroad strike earlier\nin the year resulted in damaged and burned equipment. The government\nusually intervened against strikes mounted by supposed radicals,\nwhile moderate union leaders often received President Yrigoyen's support. In the\ncase of the rail strike the president imposed a generous contract on the\ncompanies, including an eight-hour day, annual paid vacations, and sick\nand overtime pay. Yrigoyen's tactics undercut the Socialists and pushed\nthe Anarchists into confrontation, with grim consequences. Two violent\nclashes, the January 1919 Semana Tragica (Tragic Week) and the Patagonia\nTragica (1921-1922), rank among the worst labor disturbances of the early\ntwentieth century.\n<br>\nThe Semana Tragica began with a strike against a metalwork factory by\nan Anarchist union late in 1918. Fighting broke out between strikebreakers\nand workers. Heavy-handed police tactics added to the violence.\nOver the course of the next several diays, events spun out of control. \nThe Anarchist Labor Federntion's call for a genernl strike provided the pretext\nfor vigilantes, who subsequently provided the core of Liga Patriotica\nArgentina (Argentine Patriotic League). Thugs swept into the Jewish\nbarrio of Buenos Aires (popular perceptions associated Jews with\nAnarchists) and by the time the destruction ended, 700 to 1,500 people\ndied and another 4,000 had been beaten or injured. The army, without\norders from the president, assumed control of the capital. Property damage\nand lost production and wages cast the economy millions of pesos.\nYrigoyen offered to arbitrate between the parties. In the end, an alarmed\ngovernment forced the company to settle the strike. Lingering police and\nvigilante violence slowly played itself out and the Semana Tragica ended.\nUpper class perceptions that the government lacked the will or ability to\ndiscipline workers resul ted in the forma tion of the Liga Patriotica Argentina.\nThe LPA responded to fears that foreign ideologies, and labor organiziltions\ninfluenced by them, would shred the social fabric and damage the\neconomy. Manuel Carles established the League in 1919 with the idea of\nusing physical force to root out radicals. Organized as a paramilitary organization,\nthe LPA drew much of its leadership from the Jockey Club. The\nleague's mission to indoctrinate the working class to counter radicalism\nhad the support of the Church, the elite, and the middle class. A female\ndivision labored to bring the League's message to working-women. While\nthe upper and middle classes becnme more concerned, labor became\nincreasingly desperate and militant.\n<br>\nIn Patagonia, violence came on the heels of a momentary improvement\nin working conditions. In late 1920, employers, mainly British sheep operators,\norganized as the Sociedad Rural de Santa Cruz, responded positively\nto demands for better wnges and conditions. Workers wanted a limit\non the number of occupants per hut, a mattress for each person, and\nsalaries in hard currency to protect the value of wages. Unfortunately, a\ndrop in the price of wool on world markets led to deterioration of labor\nand living conditions. A general strike drew a sharp line between owners\nand workers. The issue cnme down to which side would bear the\nburden of hard times. Angry workers seized property, while landowners\nformed white guards to defend their interests. Local Radical party officials\nsided with the owners. Unbalanced reports picked up by the press\npresented an alarmist and distorted picture. After local muscle failed to\nbreak the strike, the army arrived in early 1921, believing that it faced an\nAnarchist insurrection. The Tenth Cavalry, commanded by Lt. Colonel\nHector Varela assisted by LPA members, shot suspected Anarchists in\ncold blood, tortured strikers, and dumped their bodies into mass graves.\nAfter some 2,000 victims, the strike collapsed. In a gruesome aftermath,\nColonel Varela died in a bomb blast, his assassin subsequently murdered\nby a guard, who then in turn died violently: a chain of death that shook\nthe nation.</p>	medium	t

257	The Lieutenants	1922	1927	bra2	redstar		<p class="entry columns">In many ways Brazil's hyper-federal political system failed to govern a country that was undergoing rapid social and economic change. With an impractical constitution and archaic institutions, the government could barely keep pace with the nation's progress, let alone solve its burgeoning problems. By the 1920s the tensions caused by government ineffectiveness erupted into major challenges to the state. \r\nFar and away the biggest challenge was a series of military rebellions called the Tenente Revolts (<i>tenente</i> means &quot;lieutenant&quot; in Portuguese). Civil-military relations had not been smooth since the early days of the Old Republic, and in 1922 several hundred officer cadets seized army installations to demand reforms. Their revolt was put down brutally, and those who survived were jailed or fled into exile. In 1924 the cadets captured the capital of Sao Paulo and held it for nearly a month to protest their mistreatment and blocked aspirations.

Parker	<p class="entry ">In 1924, a number of young leaders of the Federacion Obrera, who were organized in the Grupo Comunista, had broken away to establish the Sindica to General de Trabajadores (SGT). It organized several new unions, but more importantly, established the Liga de Inquilinos (Tenants' League). That organization conducted an extensive campaign to lower rents in the cities of Panama. This culminated in a general rent strike in Panama City, which was marked by considerable violence. The government of Panama thereupon asked that United States Army units from the Canal Zone intervene, which they did, establishing martial law and breaking the strike. Twenty-two people were said to have been killed and many others wounded in the process of this movement.\r\n This incident provoked severe repression of the labor movement on the part of the Panamanian government. The SGT disappeared.</p>	medium	t

He also put his personal stamp on everything. On village water pumps: &quot;Trujillo alone gives us water to drink.&quot; On a home for the aged: &quot;Trujillo is the only one who gives us shelter.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nTrujillo won the 1930 presidential election with more votes than there were registered voters, but as long as he was anti-communist, Washington was happy, so he invoked anti-communism to justify mass deportations, torture and summary execution. \r\nWorkers who asked for wage increases were labelled &quot;communists&quot; and shot on the spot, as were farmers who tried to stop Trujillo from confiscating their land. He eventually controlled over 80% of the country's sugar plantations, using slave labor provided by neighboring Haiti to keep profits high, but in 1937 he decided to blame depressed sugar prices on the Haitian workers and massacred 20,000 of them. Trujillo was finally assassinated by the CIA in 1961, after he attempted to have President Romulo Betancourt of Venezuela murdered because of his criticism of Trujillo's brutal regime (this was after a failed attempt to attack revolutionary Cuba). It was only then that the Marine Corps made public the fact that our &quot;ally&quot; Trujillo was a convicted rapist!\r\n<br>\r\n Highlights of the Trujillo era include the policy of blanquismo (whitening) and the massacre of 20-25,000 Haitians.\r\n</p><p class="entry columns" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n<strong>Some Interesting Facts</strong><br>\r\nAt the suggestion of Mario Fermin Cabral, Congress voted overwhelmingly in 1936 to rename the capital from Santo Domingo to Ciudad Trujillo. The province of San Cristobal was created as &quot;Trujillo,&quot; and the nation's highest peak, Pico Duarte, was renamed in his honor. Statues of &quot;El Jefe&quot; were mass-produced and erected across the Republic, and bridges and public buildings were named in his honor. The nation's newspapers now had praise for Trujillo as part of the front page, and license plates included the slogan &quot;Viva Trujillo!&quot; An electric sign was erected in Ciudad Trujillo so that &quot;Dios y Trujillo&quot; could be seen at night as well as in the day. Eventually, even churches were required to post the slogan, &quot;Dios en cielo, Trujillo en tierra&quot; (<i>God in Heaven, Trujillo on Earth</i>). Trujillo was recommended for the Nobel Peace Prize by his admirers, but the committee declined the suggestion. When he received (or summoned) a visitor, his four bodyguards would have submachine guns trained upon the &quot;guest&quot; during the meeting.\r\n</p>	large	f

Yet it was not until 1954 that it would execute its first full-scale covert operation in Latin America, overthrowing Guatemalan president Jacobo Arbenz and installing a more pliant successor. Arbenz, as CIA analysts and most historians today admit, was trying to implement a New Deal-style economic program to modernize and humanize Guatemala's brutal plantation economy. His only crime was to expropriate, <i>with full compensation</i>, uncultivated United Fruit Company land and legalize the Communist Party—both unacceptable acts from Washington's early-1950s vantage point.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOperation PRSUCCESS, as the CIA called its Guatemalan campaign, was the agency's most comprehensive covert action to date, much more ambitious than its operations in postwar Italy and France or in Iran the year before. Unlike the ouster of the Iranian prime minister, Mohammad Mossadeq, which took a mere couple of weeks, Arbenz's overthrow required nearly a year.  \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn addition to destabilizing Guatemala's economy, isolating the country diplomatically through the OAS, and training a mercenary force in Honduras, the Guatemalan campaign gave CIA operatives the chance to try out new psych-war techniques gleaned from behavioral social sciences. They worked with local agents to plant stories in the Guatemalan and U.S. press, engineer death threats, and conduct a bombing campaign—all designed to generate anxiety and uncertainty. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="../mapimages/ciaguatemalagasolinedepot.jpg" style="padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;"><br>&emsp;\r\n<span class="caption"> Gasoline depot bombed by CIA rebel air force</span>\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThey organized phantom groups, such as the &quot;Organization of Militant Godless,&quot; and spread rumors that the government was going to ban Holy Week, exile the archbishop, confiscate bank accounts, expropriate all private property, and force children into reeducation centers. Operatives studied pop sociologies and grifter novels and worked closely with <a href="http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/bernprop.html"  target="_blank" class="inline">Edward Bernays &#10063;</a>, a pioneer in public propaganda (and Sigmund Freud's nephew), to apply disinformation tactics. Borrowing from Orson Welles's War of the Worlds, they transmitted radio shows—taped in Florida and beamed in from Nicaragua—that made it seem as if a widespread underground resistance movement were gaining strength; they even managed to stage on-the-air battles.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Livers"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\n&emsp;\r\nIn the 1950s, the Cold War was often presented as a battle of ideas, yet CIA agents on the ground didn't see it that way. They rejected the advice of their Guatemalan allies that the campaign include an educational component, instead insisting on a strategy intended to inspire fear more than virtue. Propaganda designed to &quot;attack the theoretical foundations of the enemy&quot; was misplaced, one field operative wrote; psychological efforts should be directed at the &quot;heart, the stomach and the liver (fear).&quot; We are not running a popularity contest but an uprising,&quot; rejoined one agent to Guatemalan concerns that the campaign was too negative. U.S. planes flew low over the capital, dropping propaganda material, which for a region that hadn't seen aerial warfare since the marine campaign against Sandino sent a message beyond what was printed on the flyers. &quot;I\r\nsuppose it doesn't really matter what the leaflets say,&quot; said Tracy Barnes, who led the operation.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n<span style="background-color:#cc0000; font-size:1.2em;">The &quot;most effective leaflet drops during the operations,&quot;</span> concluded a CIA postmortem of the coup, <span style="background-color:#cc0000; font-size:1.2em;">&quot;were those followed by a successful military blow.&quot; Such blows were delivered by CIA assets in country, who bombed roads, bridges, military installations, and property owned by government supporters.</span> The agency distributed sabotage manuals that provided illustrated, step-by-step instructions on how to make pipe bombs, time bombs, remote fuses, chemical, nitroglycerine, and dynamite bombs, even explosives hidden in pens, books, and rocks. A how-to guide exhorted Guatemalans to take up violence in the name of liberty, noting that &quot;sabotage, like all things in life, is good or bad depending on whether its objective is good or bad.&quot; Such a &quot;terror program&quot; worked. Arbenz fell not because psych ops had won the hearts and minds of the population but because the military refused to defend him, fearing Washington's wrath if it repelled the mercenaries.\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAt least some American leaders were fully aware that the Guatemalan intervention marked a watershed in inter-American relations, and they did their best to limit its damage. Assistant Secretary of State Mann, for example, admitted in a private memo that CIA efforts to oust Arbenz represented Washington's first full-scale &quot;violation of the Non-intervention Agreement,&quot; the &quot;first of its kind since the establishment of the Good Neighbor Policy.&quot; Yet he hoped to hold on to the idea of the Good Neighbor policy, even as the United States corrupted its language and institutions. He therefore gave instructions that each step in the coup &quot;should be justified on technical grounds&quot; to allow the United States to claim plausibly that it was acting within the letter, if not the spirit, of Roosevelt's nonintervention pledge.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nBut on the heels of Guatemala came Cuba in 1959, a revolution that the CIA found itself powerless to reverse—even though it modeled its 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, which sought to topple Castro, on its earlier successful Guatemalan operation. Cuban revolutionaries learned well from the Guatemalan experience. Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara in fact was in Guatemala in 1954, having concluded his famous motorcycle tour of South America to work as a young, socially conscious doctor. He witnessed firsthand the effects of U.S. intervention, taking refuge in the Argentine embassy, where he would meet a number of other future Latin American revolutionaries. After a time cooling his heels, he won safe passage to Mexico, where he joined Fidel Castro's revolutionary movement in exile. &quot;Cuba will not be Guatemala,&quot; he liked to taunt Washington.\r\n</p>	large	f

His subsequent decades as the perpetual leader of the Asociacion Nacional Republicana/Partido Colorado were characterized by massive corruption, endemic human rights abuses and systematic acts of violence against purported &quot;enemies of the state.&quot; Stroessner also provided hospitality to a wide array of former Nazi leaders following World War II, including the concentration camp experimenter Dr. Josef Mengele, whom he personally protected despite repeated international demands that he be extradited to Israel. Stroessner routinely imprisoned scores of Paraguayan political opponents, some of whom later insisted that they had endured unethical medical experiments under Mengele's jurisdiction. The strongman also was notorious for his role in <font style="color:#cc0000">Operation Condor</font>, a computerized network of intelligence agencies linking Southern Cone right-wing dictatorships via a U.S.-supplied station, whose purpose was to root out and murder exiled political dissidents who sought refuge in nearby nations.<br>\r\nStroessner's autocratic reign ended in 1989 with a violent golpe instigated by General Andres Rodriguez, and he was forced to seek haven in Brazil. Since then, bringing Stroessner to justice was a slow and ultimately futile process. His mouthpiece, the ruling Partido Colorado, remained hesitant to reveal any details about the late dictator's pathological practices. While in exile, Stroessner was careful not to voice any controversial opinions regarding Latin American issues in order not to embarrass his hosts. He also never traveled outside of Brazil, hoping to avoid the fate of his Chilean counterpart Augusto Pinochet, who was arrested on charges of genocide and terrorism while traveling to London in 1998 on medical grounds. He died in 2006 at the age 93, successfully avoiding justice.

True, Figueres had just &quot;expressed appreciation for the activities of the United Fruit Company&quot; and had &quot;dislodged the commies from their powerful position&quot; in the pre-coup government. But he &quot;made himself suspect when he continued to support the Arbenz regime in Guatemala long after it was dominated by communists&quot;; that is, long after this capitalist democracy was targeted for elimination by the CIA.\r\n<br>\r\nAs yet, &quot;the commies have presented no grave problem&quot; in Costa Rica, Ambassador Woodward continued, noting that &quot;the Constitution outlaws the Communist Party.&quot; But the commies represent &quot;a potential danger&quot; because they have not been rooted out of &quot;the laboring class,&quot; and the suspect government &quot;has made no move to stamp out the movement completely,&quot; as a solid commitment to democracy would require. With the &quot;communists&quot; not eliminated entirely, there might be problems in controlling banana workers and other dangerous elements. Who can tell when these subversives might try to organize to struggle for their rights? Thirty years later, the Twentieth Century Fund warns of the problems &quot;brought on by the radicalization of the banana unions under Communist leadership,&quot; including &quot;a lengthy strike in 1984 which resulted in violence—and several deaths.&quot; These and other problems had led the United Fruit Company &quot;to turn some of its acreage over to palm oil—a less labor-intensive crop,&quot; so that such difficulties would not arise.</p>\r\n<p class="captionleft">Pictured in the background, Jose Figueres</p>	large	f

The OPS trained and armed Uruguayan police to combat the Tupumaros/MLM revolutionary forces. Torture expert Dan Mitrione comes to the OPS in 1969 and is credited with making torture &quot;routine&quot; in Uruguay.\r\n<br>\r\nIn Brazil, Mitrione and other Americans worked with OPS, AID and CIA in supplying Brazilian security forces with the equipment and training to facilitate the torture of prisoners. The Americans also advised on how much electric shock could be administered without killing the person, if his or her death might prove awkward.\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the pieces of equipment used was a wire so very thin that it could be fitted into the mouth between the teeth and by pressing against the gum increase the electrical charge. This was a technique that Mitrione had perfected in Brazil. And it was through the diplomatic pouch that Mitrione got some of the equipment he needed for interrogations, including these fine wires. \r\nDan Mitrione had built a soundproofed room in the cellar of his house in Montevideo. In this room he assembled selected Uruguayan police officers to observe a demonstration of torture techniques. Another observer was Manuel Hevia Cosculluela, a Cuban who was with the CIA and worked with Mitrione. Hevia, a double agent, later wrote that the course began with a description of the human anatomy and nervous system ...<br>\r\n<span class="blockquoteitalics">\r\nSoon things turned unpleasant. As subjects for the first testing they took beggars, known in Uruguay as bichicomes, from the outskirts of Montevideo, as well as a woman apparently from the frontier area with Brazil. There was no interrogation, only a demonstration of the effects of different voltages on the different parts of the human body, as well as demonstrating the use of a drug which induces vomiting—I don't know why or what for—and another chemical substance. The four of them died.</span>\r\nTorturing political prisoners in Uruguay had existed before Mitrione's arrival, but things got so bad in Mitrione's time that the Uruguayan Senate was compelled to undertake an investigation. After a five-month study, the commission concluded unanimously that torture in Uruguay had become a "normal, frequent and habitual occurrence", inflicted upon Tupamatos as well as others. Among the types of torture the commission's report made reference to were electric shocks to the genitals, electric needles under the fingernails, burning with cigarettes, the slow compression of the testicles, daily use of psychological torture ...

Brazilian clerics began writing treatises in 1959, and during a spirit of openness before and during the Second Vatican Council, critical analysis of the Church's role began to spread across the continent. The Peruvian priest Gustavo Gutierrez was an early leader in these discussions, sharpening the discourse during meetings in Cuba, Mexico and South America. At the Medellin Conference in 1968, priests and others began to coalesce into a movement, and in 1971, Gutierrez coined the term Liberation Theology, just as the church leadership regionally and globally began to turn against them. Cardinal Ratzenberger (later <i>Pope Benedict XVI</i>) issued the Vatican's first official condemnations of Liberation Theology as Marxist in 1984 after meetings with CELAM bishops.</p>	large	f

310	"An indigenous-centered Catholicism"	1960	1960	mex22	culture	Zapatista Timeline by Tom Hansen and Enlace Civil	<p class="entry"><img src="/mapimages/ruizchiapas.jpg" class="floatright" style="position:relative;right:0px;top:-30px;">In 1960, Samual Ruiz Garcia is named Bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas. After the Medellin Council of Latin American Bishops in 1968, Ruiz begins to promote liberation theology and an indigenous-centered Catholicism.\r\n</p><p class="entry columns3" style="clear:both;font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;top-padding:-50px;">\r\nBishop Samuel Ruiz often said that, when he was appointed to the diocese in 1959, he found little or nothing had changed in the plight of the indigenous people since the time of Las Casas, nearly 500 years ago. His own life started in poverty: the eldest of 5 children, his parents struggled to survive on a shared smallholding and a little grocery shop in Irapuato, in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato. Schooled irregular at first, in part because of stringent laws against Catholics and their schools in the 1930s post-revolutionary era of persecution of the Mexican Church. At the age of 13, however, things changed when he joined the diocesan minor seminary, even though it was not strictly legal at the time and had no fixed abode. He subsequently had a brilliant early career in the Church, going from the seminary in Mexico to ordination, postgraduate studies and a doctorate in biblical studies in Rome after World War II. On his return to Mexico he became firstly a teacher, then rector of the diocesan seminary in León and subsequently a canon of León Cathedral, before being made Bishop of San Cristobal at the early age of 35.\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived in Chiapas, the state seemed stuck in its past, but the Church in Latin America had begun a process of change, still moving today, although the new bishop was not initially aware of the shape this was taking. The Council of Latin American Bishops (CELAM) met for the first time in Rio de Janeiro in 1955 and the Catholic Church on the sub-continent started to bring together its experiences. Ruiz first followed his predecessor in encouraging the work of catechists, who by their service and the example of their own lives inspired the rest of the community. Later, he criticized this approach for its orientation towards Western attitudes and organization from the top down rather than from among the people themselves using their own cultural values. This comment comes from what is really his own testament to his work, the pastoral letter he wrote to his diocese on the occasion of the visit of Pope John Paul II to the south of Mexico in August 1993, En Esta Hora de Gracia (‘In This Hour of Grace’).\r\n<br>\r\nFrom this and other sources one can sketch what Don Samuel considered to be his own growth in understanding, his ‘conversion’ as he himself called it. He was at the Second Vatican Council and was impressed by the part played by the bishops from Africa in putting together the decree, Ad Gentes about the Church's missionary activity. They were lobbying strongly for a new approach to Christian anthropology, he said on a radio program in his retirement, which would help them more with their missionary work and value the dignity of different cultures. He referred often to the influence that Ad Gentes had on him at a time when he says he himself was still thinking of ways to teach his people to substitute Spanish for their own indigenous languages in order to evangelize them and help them economically. He began to see more clearly that the Spanish missionaries had not come just to evangelize but also to impose their culture. And now here was Ad Gentes, advising Christians to familiarize themselves with their own national and religious traditions and seek out the seeds of The Word that lay latent within these.\r\n<br>\r\nThe ‘conversion’ did not stop there. In 1968, CELAM's second conference in Medellín, Colombia, looked at ways of making Vatican II more readily applicable to the Latin American context. There was a dramatic refocusing towards the widespread misery on the sub-continent, resulting from unjust social and economic structures which the poor were powerless to change. This attention to ‘institutionalised violence’, made a profound impression. So the catechists in Don Samuel’s diocese became the spokespeople of their communities, which were considering all aspects – social, political, economic and cultural – of their situation in order to work out where the Spirit of God was leading them.\r\n<br>\r\nThe next point of departure on Don Samuel’s road was the 1974 Congress of the Indigenous he held in San Cristobal. The communities had elected speakers whom they felt led straight lives and could represent them. The catechists of the diocese now were not just there to help with traditional catechetics, with services and singing, but were genuine representatives of their communities in all the matters most important to them. There followed three days of lament for all the abuses that the indigenous peoples had suffered, with details, but also concrete suggestions about what to do in each case. By then, Don Samuel could speak two of the four languages of the indigenous present with a working knowledge of the others. He learned enough at the meeting to see the inadequacy of his diocesan pastoral plan, which he scrapped there and then and developed another based on what he had heard.\r\n<br>\r\nThe 1979 third conference of CELAM in Puebla, Mexico reinforced Don Samuel’s thinking through its advice to the Church to pursue a path of preferential option for the poor, including the 75 per cent of the people of the diocese of San Cristobal who were indigenous as well as many of those who were not. He quoted the Book of Exodus as a start in trying to help his people follow this directive: ‘I have seen the miserable state of my people in Egypt. I have heard their appeal to be free of their slave drivers. Yes, I am well aware of their sufferings.’ He also had something to say to the rest of us, interpreting St Matthew: ‘Men are blessed when, moved by the Spirit of God, they show solidarity with the poor.’\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the fourth conference of CELAM, at Santo Domingo in 1992 that in many ways satisfied Don Samuel most. In the final document’s reflections on the indigenous peoples, he explain why. ‘The action of God, through his Spirit, is present within all cultures’. ‘One task of evangelization, conducted in terms of the culture, will always be the salvation and comprehensive liberation of a particular people or human group’. Don Samuel’s growing belief and commitment of the previous 30 years now had the unequivocal backing of the Church. The Church had answered the question, at least in theory, once posed to him by one of his people: ‘If the Church does not make itself Tzeltal with the Tzeltal people, or Ch’ol with the Ch’ol people or Tojolobal with the Tojolobales, how can it call itself Catholic?’\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	large	t

Castro's shadow looms large because social and economic conditions throughout Latin America invite opposition to ruling authority and encourage agitation for radical change,&quot; for which Castro's Cuba provided a model. Earlier, Arthur Schlesinger had transmitted to the incoming President Kennedy his Latin American Mission report, which warned of the susceptibility of Latin Americans to &quot;the Castro idea of taking matters into one's own hands.&quot; The report did identify a Kremlin connection: the Soviet Union &quot;hovers in the wings, flourishing large development loans and presenting itself as the model for achieving modernization in a single generation.&quot; The dangers of the &quot;Castro idea&quot; are particularly grave, Schlesinger later elaborated, when &quot;the distribution of land and other forms of national wealth greatly favors the propertied classes&quot; and &quot;the poor and underprivileged, stimulated by the example of the Cuban revolution, are now demanding opportunities for a decent living.&quot; Kennedy feared that Russian aid might make Cuba a &quot;showcase&quot; for development, giving the Soviets the upper hand throughout Latin America.</p><p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\n&quot;The U.S. government says that a socialist regime here threatens U.S. security. But what threatens the security of the North American people is the aggressive policy of the warmongers of the United States. What threatens the security of the North American family and people is the violence, that aggressive policy, that policy that ignores the sovereignty and the rights of other peoples. The one who is threatening the security of the United States is Kennedy, with that aggressive policy. That aggressive policy can give rise to a world war; and that world war can cost the lives of tens of millions of North Americans. Therefore, the one who threatens the security of the United States is not the Cuban Revolutionary Government but the aggressor and aggressive government of the United States.\n<br>\n&quot;We do not endanger the security of a single North American. We do not endanger the life or security of a single North American family.

The US Embassy urged support for the military regime, stating that the internal security forces are behind the present government, are strongly anti- Communist, and constitute major force for stability and orderly political and economic development.&quot; Their rule was necessitated by &quot;subversive anti-government activities&quot; such as &quot;underground propaganda,&quot; the Embassy explained, offering an insight into the concept of &quot;subversion&quot; as understood by the Kennedy liberals. Dr. Fabio Castillo, a former president of the National University, testified before Congress that the US had openly participated in the countercoup and had opposed the holding of free elections. The conservative junta was quickly recognized by President Kennedy, whose preference for civil-military regimes was noted earlier*, after they had &quot;pledged to take tough actions against the students [who had protested against the outlawing of political parties, the main proof offered of a Communist plot], cut relations with Castro, and warmly welcomed foreign investment.&quot; The trends of earlier years continued: production, including food production, increased, largely for export, along with starvation and general misery. These trends were enhanced by the Alliance for Progress programs of Kennedy and Johnson. By 1969, 300,000 Salvadorans (one in eight citizens) had fled to Honduras to find food and work. Military aid rapidly increased along with US training and coordination of the military and other security forces of the region.\r\n<br>\r\n<span class="caption"><i>Pictured</i>, Julio Carballo, center, leader of the counter-coup.</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="position:relative;top:30px;font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n*There is no point\r\nwasting time in patiently explaining to our leaders that the policies they\r\npursue are inconsistent with the goals they profess; they know this well\r\nenough without our help. Nor is there any reason to suppose that a\r\ndifferent group of leaders would react in any essentially different way to\r\nthe same institutional imperatives. It is not failure to understand a\r\nsimple point so clear to us that regularly leads the political leadership to\r\ncommit the same “error” over and over again.\r\n<br>&emsp;Returning to [George] Kennan’s prescriptions, what means must we use\r\nagainst our enemies who fall prey to the heresy that threatens our\r\nresources? Kennan explains, in the same briefing to the Ambassadors:\r\n<span class="blockquote">\r\nThe final answer might be an unpleasant one, but . . . we should\r\nnot hesitate before police repression by the local government. This\r\nis not shameful since the Communists are essentially traitors . . .\r\nIt is better to have a strong regime in power than a liberal\r\ngovernment if it is indulgent and relaxed and penetrated by\r\nCommunists.</span>\r\n\r\n&emsp;Again, as policy becomes practice, the term “Communists” takes on\r\nits technical sense in American political discourse, referring to people\r\nwho do not appreciate the sanctity of the Fifth Freedom.\r\n<br>&emsp;It is small wonder, then, that John F. Kennedy should have held that\r\n“governments of the civil-military type of El Salvador are the most\r\neffective in containing Communist penetration in Latin America.” This\r\nwas after a military coup overthrew a liberal civilian government, with\r\nUS approval, while the Kennedy Administration was organizing the basic\r\nstructure of the military and paramilitary “death squads” that have\r\nmassacred tens of thousands of civilians since, within the framework of\r\nthe Alliance for Progress—in fact, the most lasting effect of that program apart from its contributions to dependent development in the US\r\ninterest.</p>	large	f

Mostly he\r\nharped on one theme–the evil of unions, which he ranked second only to\r\ncommunists in their desire to snatch away the god-given profits of the working\r\nbusinessman. Under no circumstances, he told them, should the cancer of\r\nunionism be allowed to affect the plant.\r\n<br>&emsp;<img src="/mapimages/cokebottle.png" class="floatright" style="transform: rotate(175deg);">\r\nWorkers at the Coke plant at the time suffered under inhuman working\r\nconditions, spending twelve-hour shifts loading crates at the minimum wage of\r\n$2 a day. By spring of 1976, more than 80 percent of the two hundred-some\r\nworkers signed papers to unionize in an effort to improve their lot. When union\r\nleaders Israel Márquez and Pedro Quevedo presented the petition to Trotter,\r\nhowever, the Texan refused to recognize it, firing 154 workers. With the law on\r\ntheir side, the workers successfully sued for reinstatement–but Trotter and local\r\nexecutives continued to break up the union, subdividing the bottler into other\r\ncompanies to make it more difficult for workers to organize. The Coke workers\r\nreached out to the Catholic Church for help, and were answered by a\r\nPhiladelphia-based order of nuns called the Sisters of Providence, who owned\r\ntwo hundred shares of Coca-Cola stock–as a way to generate wealth for their\r\norder and to influence policy abroad.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n\r\nHorrified to hear of the situation, its leader, Sister Dorothy Garland, contacted\r\nthe Coca-Cola Company to demand changes. Coke's president, Luke Smith,\r\nadmitted tension, but said the franchise agreement tied the company's hands.\r\n"There is no provision in the bottlers' agreement . . . which give us any right to\r\nintervene on such a dispute," he explained. Undeterred, the nuns filed a\r\nshareholders' resolution at the company's annual meeting in 1977 to demand an\r\nindependent investigation into the issue.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style="float:right;border-style: double;padding:9px;\r\nborder-color: #cc0000;\r\nborder: 6px double #cc0000;\r\noutline: 3px solid #cc0000;\r\noutline-offset: -1px;\r\nwidth:425px;\r\nbackground-color:white;\r\nfont-family: arial, helvetica;\r\nfont-size: .9em;">\r\n<span class="medhed" style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Coca-Cola Killings</span>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class="date">1979</span><br>\r\n<strong>5 April</strong> Manuel Lapez Balam, general secretary of STEGAC (Trade Union of Workers in the Guatemala Bottling and Associated Companies), is killed by a group armed with knives and iron bars as he is delivering crates of Coca-Cola.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>18 June</strong> Silverio Vâsquez, an EGSA worker, is shot and wounded by a plant security guard.

Fredy Maldonado, the production manager, besides having a degree in business was also an army officer. There was a captain there, as well as a lieutenant who was in charge of personnel, Lieutenant Francisco Javier Rodas. They were army officers, regulars in the army. Therefore, it was very delicate working in the plant. Many people quit despite wages that were a bit higher than those paid in other workplaces. They couldn't find security or stability within the company.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nI began to become more and more involved in the union but always as a rank-and-file member and not a leader. We began to form support groups for the executive committee of the union. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn 1980, problems intensified, not only in the Coca-Cola factory but also throughout the entire country. Even though a collective bargaining pact was in place, it wasn't enforced. The staff was subjected to inhumane treatment. For instance, our official workday began in the sales department at seven o'clock in the morning, but we had to arrive by six o'clock to wash the truck and prepare for the day. However, the clock didn't begin to count our working time until seven o'clock. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThere was much pressure on the staff, but there was also a great crisis at the national level. Later on, right after the assassination of compañero Manuel López in April of 1980, my compañero Marlon also was assassinated. Marlon had joined Coca-Cola with my group, and he, too, became involved in the union after his hiring. Marlon was very conscious of his role as a worker, and, in spite of the fact that the company had hired him to cause problems, he joined the union almost immediately. He was assassinated in April of 1980. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThis assassination polarized the situation even more. After they killed the compañero Marlon, the personnel manager Lieutenant Francisco Javier Rodas was killed. He was a very aggressive person. Later, during the May Day demonstration, many people were kidnapped. A lot. The exact number was never known. At least two Coca-Cola workers were kidnapped, and their bodies appeared, cruelly tortured and mutilated. And many more compañeros from other unions were disappeared. A direct confrontation broke out when the revolutionary organizations responded...\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAt about eleven o'clock in the morning on June 21st, the CNT was\r\nbroken into and all the people attending the meeting were taken\r\naway. Included in this group were two compañeros from the Coca-Cola\r\nunion. Later, these leaders were referred to as the "detained-disappeared."\r\nThis was a kidnapping, but it began with a detention,\r\nwith an office broken into, and a door broken down by a police car.\r\nWhen a request Is made that someone be presented to the court,\r\na writ of habeus corpus must be used. We did this, and the court\r\nsaid, "We don't have access to them; it's a police matter." So we\r\nmembers of the Coca-Cola union decided to go on strike until the\r\ncompañeros reappeared or were released. The company asked for\r\npolice intervention; however, we were able to maintain a strike for\r\nmany days. One day, two compañeros were Injured when several\r\nmen drove by in cars and on motorcycles shooting with machine\r\nguns into the factory. This did not intimidate us; we continued to\r\nput on the pressure.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nMy participation at that time was as a rank-and-fiIe member. We\r\ncarried out what the executive committee determined had to be\r\ndone. The executive committee ordered us to block the entrances\r\nwith trucks, to block them as much as possible with bottles.' We\r\nhad occupied the plant.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe police came, and two more compañeros were captured. The\r\npolice confronted us and said whoever didn't want to work could\r\nleave the factory. They ordered that the strike be ended. There were\r\nabout two hundred heavily armed police with weapons aimed at\r\nus. It is tough to disobey an order when there are machine guns\r\naimed at you. So factory operations were restarted, but the\r\ncompañeros for whom that strike was carried out never reappeared."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<span class="entry_source">The Sky Never Changes: Testimonies from the Guatemalan Labor Movement  By Thomas F.

The nuns cried foul, even as a new\r\npresident assumed power in Guatemala in 1978. General Romeo Lucas Garcia\r\nwas one in a long line of military leaders who had ruled the country since a \r\n<a data-entry="290" data-year="1954" class="inline" style="color:black;font-weight:bold;">CIA-sponsored coup in the 1950s.</a> But the avowed anticommunist was particularly\r\nbrutal in his crackdown on "subversive elements," directing his secret police to\r\nrout any leftist influences in government, academia, and industry–including unions.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of the situation, Trotter threatened the union organizers\r\nwith violence if they didn't give up their efforts. Shortly thereafter, Israel\r\nMárquez was sprayed by machine-gun fire in his jeep, narrowly escaping with\r\nhis life. Pedro Quevedo wasn't so lucky. Sitting in his truck during deliveries, he\r\nwas ambushed by two men, who pumped four rounds into his face, then another\r\neight into his throat before driving away on waiting motorcycles. Another union\r\nleader, Manuel Lopez Balan, was also killed, his throat slit while making\r\ndeliveries on his route.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nEven as most of the workers resigned from the union, Marquez traveled to\r\nWilmington to confront Coke chairman Paul Austin at the 1978 annual meeting.\r\nIn a soft voice, he detailed the murders of his colleagues, before directly\r\nappealing to Austin's business sense. <span style="font-family: helvetica;\r\nfont-weight: bold; font-size: .9em;">"Coca-Cola's image in Guatemala could\r\nnot be worse," said the small Guatemalan man through a translator. "[In\r\nGuatemala,] murder is called 'Coca-Cola.'</span> I have come here today to ask your\r\nimmediate help so that blood no longer flows through the Coca-Cola plant."\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn truth, Austin's hands were tied–intervene in the dispute and he'd call the\r\nentire franchise system into question, potentially opening the Coca-Cola\r\nCompany up to a flood of labor complaints from other countries. At the same\r\ntime, if he didn't intervene, he'd abrogate all the goodwill he'd so eagerly sought\r\nthrough Coke's "Corporate Social Responsibility" efforts. Even as Coke execs privately decided not to renew\r\n\r\nTrotter's contract, they declined to break it, instead sending another company\r\nexec to investigate the situation. He, too, exonerated the franchisee–and no\r\nwonder, since he never even questioned Trotter or set foot inside the plant.\r\nUnconvinced, the Guatemalans appealed to the International Union of Food and\r\nAllied Workers (lUF), a Geneva-based super-union, which issued a call to\r\nboycott Coke in November 1979 and instigated work stoppages al Coke plants in\r\nFinland, Sweden, and New Zealand.\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/cokebottle.png" class="floatright" style="transform: rotate(185deg);">\r\n&emsp;\r\nAs the situation quickly grew out of hand, the company assured critics that it\r\nwould not be renewing Trotter's contract when it expired in 1981. Meanwhile,\r\nthe rampage continued, with four more union organizers killed. Street protests\r\nagainst Coke in Guatemala led to a dramatic fall in the company's market share.\r\nFinally, the pressure was too much for Coke to stall any longer. Even though it\r\nhad repeatedly claimed it could do nothing until the contract expired, company\r\nexecs flew to Houston in July 1980 to present Trotter with an offer he couldn't\r\nrefuse–a generous buyout by two handpicked bottling executives, with most of\r\nthe financing provided by Coke Atlanta, and no questions asked. The new\r\nowners approved a contract with the union after the sale.\r\nBut Coke's stalling had left eight workers dead–a legacy in Guatemala that\r\nwould come to haunt the company again in more recent years.\r\n</p>	large	f

Robert Kennedy was dispatched to Brazil in December 1962 to influence Goulart to &quot;confront the communist problem,&quot; as the US Embassy put it. RFK informed Goulart that the President was seriously concerned about the infiltration of &quot;Communists and anti-American nationalist leftists&quot; into the government, the military, the unions, and student groups, and about the &quot;ill treatment [of] American and other foreign private investors.&quot; If Goulart wanted US aid, Kennedy said, he must see to it that &quot;personnel in key Brazilian positions&quot; were pro-American, and impose economic measures that the US recommended.\n\nRelations remained tense, particularly over the austerity plan that the Kennedy Administration demanded as a condition for aid, and its admonitions about left-wing influence. </p>	medium	t

The chief of Mongoose operations, Edward Lansdale, provided a timetable leading to &quot;open revolt and overthrow of the Communist regime&quot; in October 1962. The &quot;final definition&quot; of the program recognized that &quot;final success will require decisive U.S. military intervention,&quot; after terrorism and subversion had laid the basis. The implication is that US military intervention would take place in October 1962—when the missile crisis erupted.\r\n<br>\r\nIn February 1962, the Joint Chiefs of Staff approved a plan more extreme than Schlesinger's: to use &quot;covert means . . . to lure or provoke Castro, or an uncontrollable subordinate, into an overt hostile reaction against the United States; a reaction which would in turn create the justification for the US to not only retaliate but destroy Castro with speed, force and determination.&quot; In March, at the request of the DOD Cuba Project, the Joint Chiefs of Staff submitted a memorandum to Defense Secretary Robert McNamara outlining &quot;pretexts which they would consider would provide justification for US military intervention in Cuba.&quot; The plan would be undertaken if &quot;a credible internal revolt is impossible of attainment during the next 9-10 months,&quot; but before Cuba could establish relations with Russia that might &quot;directly involve the Soviet Union.&quot;\r\n<br>\r\nOn August 23 the president issued National Security Memorandum No. 181, &quot;a directive to engineer an internal revolt that would be followed by U.S. military intervention,&quot; involving &quot;significant U.S. military plans, maneuvers, and movement of forces and equipment&quot; that were surely known to Cuba and Russia. Also in August, terrorist attacks were intensified, including speedboat strafing attacks on a Cuban seaside hotel &quot;where Soviet military technicians were known to congregate, killing a score of Russians and Cubans&quot;; attacks on British and Cuban cargo ships; the contamination of sugar shipments; and other atrocities and sabotage, mostly carried out by Cuban exile organizations permitted to operate freely in Florida. A few weeks later came &quot;the most dangerous moment in human history.&quot;\r\n<br>\r\n<font class="bigquote">&quot;A bad press in some friendly countries&quot;</font><br>\r\nTerrorist operations continued through the tensest moments of the missile crisis. They were formally canceled on October 30, several days after the Kennedy and Khrushchev agreement, but went on nonetheless. On November 8, &quot;a Cuban covert action sabotage team dispatched from the United States successfully blew up a Cuban industrial facility,&quot; <font style="color:#cc0000">killing 400 workers</font>, according to the Cuban government. Raymond Garthoff writes that &quot;the Soviets could only see [the attack] as an effort to backpedal on what was, for them, the key question remaining: American assurances not to attack Cuba.&quot; These and other actions reveal again, he concludes, &quot;that the risk and danger to both sides could have been extreme, and catastrophe not excluded.&quot;</p>	large	f

His inaugural call that America\r\nwas ready to &quot;pay any price, bear any burden&quot; revived a muscular internationalism\r\nthat had atrophied. In addition to bringing in Robert\r\nMcNamara\r\n<img src="/mapimages/generalmaxwelltaylor.jpg" class="floatright"> from the Ford Motor Company to rationalize the Department\r\nof Defense, Kennedy and his civilian advisers looked to\r\ncounterinsurgency and covert operations as a way of both breaking\r\nthe nuclear deadlock and controlling the rise of third-world nationalism. Kennedy ordered the military to create a branch of the Special Forces that could operate with more flexibility in the third world and\r\nset up a &quot;Special Group&quot; in the White House, headed by General\r\nMaxwell Taylor, <i>pictured (from his TIme Magazine Cover)</i>, to coordinate special-warfare policy at the highest\r\nechelons of government—with the result that superpower conflict\r\nwas detoured outside of Europe, particularly into Southeast Asia .\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn Latin America, Kennedy's vaulting idealism led to the Alliance\r\nfor Progress, an ambitious project that wedded the revolutionary\r\nand counterrevolutionary traditions of American diplomacy—as\r\ndid Theodore Roosevelt and other missionary presidents of an earlier\r\nera—this time to especially toxic effect. Announcing the program\r\nto a room full of Latin American ambassadors soon after his\r\ninauguration, Kennedy sought to steal Castro's insurgent thunder,\r\ncommitting Washington to &quot;completing the revolution of the\r\nAmericas.&quot; He promised billions of dollars in development aid in exchange\r\nfor enacting land, tax, judicial, and electoral reform aimed at\r\nbreaking up extreme concentrations of economic and political\r\npower, &quot;to build,&quot; as the president put it, &quot;a hemisphere where all\r\nmen can hope for a suitable standard of living and all can live out\r\ntheir lives in dignity and in freedom.&quot;\r\n<span style="float:right">\r\n<iframe width="350" height="262" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7Co6rjlprsg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>\r\n&quot;Let us once again transform\r\nthe American Continent into a vast crucible of revolutionary ideas\r\nand efforts,&quot; Kennedy roared, &quot;a tribute to the power of the creative\r\nenergies of free men and women, an example to all the world\r\nthat liberty and progress walk hand in hand.

Advisers from the State and Defense\r\nDepartments and the CIA worked to reinforce local intelligence\r\noperations, schooling security forces in interrogation and\r\nguerrilla warfare techniques, providing technology and equipment,\r\nand, when necessary, conducting preemptive coups. It was\r\nduring this period that national intelligence agencies fortified\r\nand, in some cases, created by the United States—Argentina's Secretaria\r\nde Inteligencia del Estaclo, Chile's Direccion Nacional de\r\nInteligencia, Brazil's Sistema Nacional de lnformacoes, El Salvador's\r\nAgencia Nacional de Servicios Especiales—began to transform themselves\r\ninto the command centers of the region's death-squad\r\nsystem, which throughout the 1970s and 1980s executed hundreds\r\nof thousands of Latin Americans and tortured tens of thousands\r\nmore.

Their myths relate how\r\ntheir first ruler, Manco Capac, brought the tribe to that valley either from\r\nthe shores of Lake Titicaca or, in another version, from the 'windows' or\r\ncaves at Paccari-Tambo, a place some eighteen miles south-east of Cuzco.\r\nLike Quetzalcoatl for the Toltecs and Aztecs, the mythical figure of Manco\r\nCapac was revered as the bringer of civilization to the world; he was also\r\nworshipped for being a direct descendant of the Sun God, a family connection\r\nwhich gave Inca rulers a quasi-divine status.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn the late fourteenth century the Incas subjugated the other tribes in\r\nthe Cuzco valley, and their imperial career began in earnest in 1438, when the\r\ngreat conqueror, Yupanqui Inca Pachacuti, 'the Transformer', ascended the\r\nthrone. Between 1438 and 1463 he extended Inca rule to the region of Lake\r\nTiticaca, and thence north-west.

Like that of the Aztecs, their dominion was\r\ncharacterized essentially by the levying of tribute from scores of subject\r\nkingdoms and tribes. But the Incas went much further than the Aztecs in\r\ndeveloping a centralized bureaucratic state at the service of a supreme ruling\r\nclass. In this the physical peculiarities of the Andean region were directly\r\ninfluential.\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Agriculture"></div>\r\n\r\n<div class="entry" style="background-color: #FAFAFA; background-image: url(/mapimages/incaagriculture.jpg);height: 710px;\r\nwidth: 1020px; position: relative; left: -10px; top: -53px;">\r\n\r\n<p style="width: 602px; background-color: #FAFAFA; padding:9px;position: relative; top: 31px;">\r\n&emsp;\r\nThe geography of the area covered by the Inca empire is marked by great\r\ncontrasts of climate and terrain. Ascending from the rainless deserts of the\r\ncoast to the snow-capped peaks of the Andes, one passes through sharply\r\nvarying ecological environments. On the coast, agriculture is possible only\r\nin the vicinity of rivers or on land under irrigation; fishing has therefore\r\nalways been important. In the highlands, altitude determines the kind of\r\ncrops that can be produced; for instance, maize will grow well up to 11,000\r\nfeet while at higher levels tubers and grams can be cultivated. In the cold,\r\nwindswept puna - steppe-like grasslands just below the snow-line - no\r\nagriculture is possible, though pasture is available for the llamas, vicunas and\r\nother ruminants that provide meat and wool. Each level forms an 'ecological\r\ntier' yielding a particular range of produce, and yet there is not enough fertile\r\nland on any one tier to sustain a large population.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOver the centuries Andean societies developed a way of overcoming this\r\nproblem by sending out settlers to cultivate crops at different altitudes in\r\norder to complement the produce of their native territories. Andean societies\r\nwere not therefore territorially integrated units, but took rather the form of\r\n"vertical archipelagos" comprising the ancestral homeland - which provided\r\nthe core of tribal identity - and outlying agrarian settlements on a number\r\nof ecological tiers specializing in various types of produce for distribution\r\nand exchange among the dispersed branches of the tribe. Geography thus\r\nproduced a unique economic structure, which, in turn, determined social\r\nvalues and practices. Where fertile land, being scarce, needed to be so carefully\r\nhusbanded, it is little wonder that its distribution had to be closely regulated\r\nby the community and that a spirit of co-operation should be so highly\r\nprized among members of the tribe. As a result, the two ruling principles of\r\nAndean tribal society were redistribution and reciprocity.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Structure"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\n&emsp;The basic social unit was the <strong>Ayllu</strong>, an extended kinship group or clan\r\nsimilar to the calpulli in Middle America. Each ayllu possessed land which it\r\nallocated to heads of families, who could cultivate it for themselves but were\r\nnot allowed to sell it to others. It was common practice within the ayllu for\r\nan individual member to work a neighbour's fields in return for similar\r\nassistance; he would also render tribute by taking turn to labour for a time\r\nin the fields of the ayllu headman and the tribal chieftains. Given the intrinsic\r\ndifficulties of the terrain, the ayllus had to join together to perform certain\r\ncollective tasks, such as the building of terraces to enlarge the area of\r\ncultivation and the construction of systems of irrigation. Because of the threat\r\nof crop failure in such a fickle climate, a number of public warehouses were\r\nused to store grain and other crops for distribution in case of famine. The\r\nproduce from the different ecological tiers had to be distributed to all the\r\nayllus in the tribe. Thus the geography of the Andes dictated a high degree\r\nof collective action and central regulation within the tribal communities.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe Incas elaborated upon these traditional practices of communal regulation and reciprocal services in order to build an imperial state. Inca imperialism did not eliminate local identities; rather, it added a higher stratum of\r\nauthority to the pre-existing tribal hierarchies. Traditional ethnic chieftains,\r\nunder the supervision of Inca governors and Inca garrisons, were responsible\r\nfor the collection of tribute from their people for the Inca aristocracy. Tribute\r\nwas received from subject peoples largely in the form of labour. The local\r\ntraditions of collective work were taken over by the imperial state and\r\ntransformed into the mita, a system of forced labour by which the colonized\r\nSupreme Being, Viracocha, creator of the universe, from\r\nwere ultimately derived. The doctrine of Viracocha's pre-eminence,\r\nhowever, did not displace the cult of the Sun God. Inca cosmogony, like \r\nthat of the Aztecs and the Mayas, divided the history of the universe into\r\n'suns', each age having been brought to an end by a cataclysm. The Fifth\r\nSun had been inaugurated by the Inca Manco Capac, and it was his descendants who were charged with ensuring the continuing survival of the world through sacrifice and expiation. Although not as prodigal of human life as\r\nthe Aztecs, the Incas sacrificed youths, girls and children - all of whom had\r\nto be physically perfect - on occasions when the usual sacrifice of llamas was\r\ndeemed insufficient to save the world from calamity.\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="testorama"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\nThe religious establishment was large and influential. A hierarchy of\r\npriests, headed by immediate relatives of the Inca himself, served the many\r\ntemples and huacas found throughout the empire: at the Temple of the Sun\r\nin Cuzco some 4,000 people were engaged in the ministry of the state\r\nreligion. Religious communities of 'chosen women', who were recruited as\r\nyoung girls from all parts of the empire, performed a variety of duties: some\r\nmight be selected for sacrifice to the gods, others as concubines for the Inca\r\nand his favorites; the rest would be employed in weaving precious vicuna\r\nwool into garments for the royal family, or in preparing food and libations\r\nfor the frequent ceremonies that were held by priests and nobles.\r\nThis very close identification of religion with government afforded enormous power to the Inca state. In the remains of great buildings in Cuzco, in the massive fortress of Sacsahuaman or in the ruined city of Macchu Picchu,\r\nall constructed with huge boulders cut to shape and fitted exactly into place,\r\nthere survive impressive monuments to its extraordinary capacity to mobilize\r\nhuman labour. Perhaps extreme regimentation by the state was necessary to\r\ncompensate for technical deficiencies in an otherwise sophisticate civilization: without beasts of burden or knowledge of the wheel, the Incas depended crucially on manpower. But their true success lay in the skill with which they built up a polity that transcended by far the limits of the tribe.\r\nThe business of government was turned into a dynastic monopoly based on privileged knowledge, not just as regards the arcana of religion but also at a\r\nmore mundane level: the absence of a system of writing restricted important information to a closed oligarchy, who had access to records kept on knotted cords known as quipus. Such privileged knowledge increased the possibilities\r\nof political control over the passive multitude of commoners whose cultures remained entirely oral. So long as belief in the divine origin of the Inca dynasty and in its right to extensive privileges could be upheld, the edifice\r\nof state would remain in place. In 1531, however, Francisco Pizarro\r\nand his company of infidels found their way into the Inca empire, Tahuantin-suyu,\r\ncausing that great pyramid of state to collapse when they violated the sacred\r\npinnacle of its authority.\r\n<br>\r\nIn the Lima museum, there are hundreds of skulls which have undergone trepanning and the insertion of gold and silver plates by Inca surgeons. </p>	large	t

Hoping to professionalize Guatemala's intelligence system, Longan and other American advisors centralized the operations of the police and military, training them to gather, analyze and act on intelligence in a coordinated and rapid manner. Longan identified a need for "fundamental elementary work in organization, coordination, and basic police activity." \r\n<br>&emsp;On December 5, he held the first in a series of workshops with the heads of the Judicial and National Police, military officers, including Colonel Rafael Arriaga Bosque, and two other US public safety advisors. Longan laid out plans for combined "overt" and "covert" operations collectively called "Operacion Limpieza" - Operation Cleanup. In the overt phase of the operation, the "Army, the Judicial Police, and the National Police" would carry out sweeps in "suspect areas in hope that some criminal or subversive elements could be caught in net and lead to further openings." Longan instructed the officers in a maneuver dubbed the "frozen area plan," which entailed the cordoning off a four block radius, establishing an outer perimeter, and searching the secured area for subversives and information. On the covert side, Longan recommended the creation of a small "action unit to mastermind campaign against terrorists which would have access to all information from law enforcement agencies. . . ." A team of "trusted investigators" would work from a "special room to be called 'The Box,'" a 24-hour nerve center equipped with telecommunications and electronic surveillance equipment staffed by military colonels and captains and located at Matamoros, the military's general headquarters in downtown Guatemala City. Responsibility for the full operation, including command of "The Box," was given to Arriaga Bosque, the commanding officer of Matamoros. The overt and covert sides of the proposed operation complemented each other. Intelligence picked up from wide sweeps using the frozen area plan was to be sent to 'The Box' to be analyzed and deployed in more focused clandestine raids, which in turn would provide information for larger dragnets.\r\n<br>&emsp;Equipped with state of the art telecommunications and surveillance equipment and operating out of military headquarters, Arriaga began to carry out widespread raids. By the end of February, eighty operations&#8212;and a number of extrajudicial executions&#8212;had taken place. Then between March 3 and March 5, Operacion Limpieza netted its largest catch. On March 2, the military and police picked up three guerrilla leaders. On the third, the police captured Leonardo Leonardo Castillo Flores, who headed the national peasant union under Arbenz, and three other PGT-FAR members on the south coast. The next day, the fourth, special security officers from Guatemala City arrived to interrogate the prisoners, which according to a CIA document apparently yielded information on Guatemala City safe houses. The following day, the police and military detained a number of PGT leaders, including Victor Manuel Gutierrez - the head of the national labor union under Arbenz. By March 5, security forces had captured scores of members of the PGT, FAR, and MR-13 (a Trotskist split from the FAR) in coordinated operations throughout the country, including the capital and the southern coast. The oft stated US goal of effective use of intelligence and coordinated operations between police and military and between the countryside and the city was now a reality.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="...The Covert"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="columns" style="padding:9px;background:white;">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/victormanuelgutierrez.jpg" class="floatright">&emsp;Judicial Police took Gutierrez to their downtown headquarters, where they submitted him to a torture dubbed la capucha. They covered his head with cowl and shocked him with electric currents, which according to one witness quickly proved too much for Gutierrez, who suffered from a frail heart. Security forces transferred most of the rest of those captured in Guatemala City to the Matamoros military base, where 'The Box' was located. They were interrogated, tortured, executed, and their bodies placed in sacks and dropped into the Pacific. Years later, Longan recalled that some of their remains washed back onto shore. The exact number is not known, but, along with Castillo Flores and Gutierrez, the police and military murdered at least thirty people over the course of four days. In July, a defector from the national police told the newspaper El Grafico that execution orders came from Arriaga Bosque, the man in charge of the new US "action unit." \r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;US embassy officials admitted that the killings were carried out under the auspices of Operacion Limpieza. The embassy's March progress report, which enumerated its paragraphs, stated in paragraph number four that the Guatemalan government scored "a considerable success when they captured a number of leading Communists, including Victor Manuel Gutierrez [and] Leonardo Castillo Flores." Paragraph twenty-three then matter-of-factly noted that the police "have conducted 80 raids during the past month using the 'frozen area plan'. The raids have been productive in apprehensions (see paragraph 4)." Despite pleas from Guatemala's archbishop and over 500 petitions of habeas corpus filed by relatives, the government and the American Embassy remained silent about the fate of the executed.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<i>&emsp;Among those eliminated in this first collective Latin American Cold War disappearance were former Arbenz advisors who advocated a negotiated settlement to the still embryonic civil war and a return of the left to the electoral arena. After their executions, a young, Cuba-influenced generation of revolutionaries dismissed such a position as not only naive but suicidal. Even the CIA admitted that an "intolerable status quo" combined with the "efficiency" of the U.S.-cleated security forces drove "usually moderate groups to violence." \r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Operacion Limpieza was a decisive step forward in the radicalization of not just Guatemala's civil war but the broader Latin American Cold War, foreshadowing the application of similar tactics of "disappearances" throughout the continent in the 1970s and 1980s. In Guatemala, it strengthened an intelligence system with central command over death squads that through the course of the civil war would be responsible for tens of thousands of disappearances and executions and countless tortures. It invested awesome power in Arriaga Bosque (one of Guatemala's "most effective and enlightened leaders," according to the American Embassy), who a few months after these executions would lead Guatemala's first scorched-earth campaign (1966-1967) that killed 8,000 civilians, mostly in the eastern lowland part of the country, in order to uproot a few hundred guerrillas." </i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f

In the beginning of August (during the Mexican school year), tens of thousands of colleged students undertook a notably non-violent march and began an occupation of the university. During massive marches in mid-September, the President sent troops in to violently break up the students' control of the campus and other parts of the city. During the military attacks on the occupation of the Polytechnic campuses on September 23rd, students put up resistance and were fired upon. Fifteen were killed. \r\n<br>\r\nA demonstration was held on October 2nd in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas, ten days before the city was to host the 1968 Olympics. Thousands of soldiers and hundreds of armored trucks and tanks surrounded the students. From hundreds and up to a thousand were gunned down.\r\n<br>\r\nThe repression convinces many activists to carry their struggle underground. Over the next decade, over two dozen urban guerilla groups develop through-out Mexico. The most active guerilla activity is between 1971 and 1975. Most movements disintegrate under brutal repression and a dirty war, which leave over hundreds of activists &quot;disappeared&quot; and over 1,000 dead.\r\n<br>\r\nAn investigation completed in 2001 declared that the army's claim that students fired first from nearby apartments was false, and that it had been Presidential Guard agents who are begun firing at the soldiers to serve as the impetus for the massacre.

864	The Rio Treaty	1947	1947	usa1	power	The School of the Americas: Military Training and Political Violence in the Americas	<p class="entry columns">\r\nDuring the late 1940s and 1950s, the stated goal of U.S. military strategy in Latin America was to train and equip security forces to repel an attack by a nonhemispheric power, particularly the Soviet Union. Together with twenty Latin American countries, the United States signed the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, better known as the Rio Treaty, in 1947. The Rio Treaty was one of several mutual defense agreements formulated by the United States, and its main purpose was to organize a united front against an attack. Yet an Holden indicates, "military grant aid was extended to Latin America not to defend it from attack but to help encourage 3 cooperative attitude". The real agenda was less "'hemispheric defense" than a for more traditional concern, the maintenance of U.S. dominance in the Americas and the control over raw materials. This project required political stability and governments willing to cooperate with the United States, and, perhaps more importantly, it entailed suppressing the domestic opponents of friendly regimes. The provision of arms became an important means through which the United States purchased the collaboration of militaries, enhanced their power vis-a-vis domestic challengers, and kept nonhemispheric contenders and weapons suppliers at bay. The commanding general of the Caribbean Defense Command understood the importance of arms sales very well when he noted in a 1045 memo to the War Department that \r\n<br>\r\n<i>it is an established fact that if equipment to supply these armies is not forthcoming in the near future, we face the probability that Mission contacts will not be renewed. It took the war and the elimination of our chief competitors co put us in the unique position we occupy today. Immediate action must be taken to furnish arms and equipment to our Latin American neighbors. Even now we are confronted with the probability of losing the advantage we have gained at high cost and much effort.</i><br>\r\nThe general did not have to worry. Although Latin American commanders had complained of difficulties in securing armaments doting World War II, the postwar era created more favorable conditions for arms sales to the region. Defense manufacturers sought out new markets for their wares, and Congress created generous military aid programs. Facilitating arms transfers not only helped to secure U.S. access to raw materials and the general cooperation of regional militaries, it also tied Latin American militaries to the use, and thus the continued purchase, of technology produced in the United States. The defense establishment referred to the latter as "standardizing" Latin American militaries, and the Caribbean Defense commander put it bluntly when he stated that "standardizing" Latin American armies with U.S. equipment furthered the "penetration of the United States into the military system of any country so that such nation becomes dependent on us.\r\n</p>	large	t

They embarked on a process of collecting archive material—newsreels—and recording testimonies of militants of the so-called Peronist Resistance (a period of popular struggles beginning with Peron's fall in 1955), of intellectuals and university leaders. This search made the filmmakers travel all over the country and was reflected in the film's subtitle, 'Notes and Testimonies on Neocolonialism, Violence and Liberation'.\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout this process (from late 1965 to mid-1968), the directors gradually modified their original proposal and part of their ideas. They incorporated the revisionist view of history and a look on the Peronist working class as the main subject of Argentina's revolutionary transformation. They experienced, as well as many other intellectuals in those years, a journey from the traditional left into a national left. With a new military regime coming to power in 1966, because of the film's adhesion to proscribed Peronism and in particular to its most radicalised wing, its revolutionary proposals and the will to inscribe it into the struggles for social change, they had to resort to an alternative exhibition circuit.\r\n<br>\r\nThe formal organisation of La Hora de los Hornos is inextricably linked to these objectives. Its total running time of four hours 15 minutes is structured into three parts, each with a different formal treatment, theme and even objective. The first section, 'Neocolonialism and Violence', was conceived as an essay film, which discusses the neocolonial nature of Argentine and Latin American dependency through 13 chapters. The second part, 'Act for Liberation', is divided in two, reflecting specific time periods: Chronicle of Peronism and Chronicle of Resistance. Conceived as a film act and dedicated to the 'Peronist proletarians', these two chronicles respectively deal with an analysis of the ten years of Peronism in power (1946-55) and a critical reconstruction of the ensuing struggles (1956-66). The third part, 'Violence and Liberation', dedicated to 'the new man who is being born out of this liberation war', presents itself as a study on the meaning of violence. (<i>The entire film can be found online</i>)</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n&quot;Guerrilla film-making proletarianises the film worker and breaks down the intellectual aristocracy that the bourgeoisie grants to its followers. In a word, it democratises. The film-maker's tie with reality makes him more a part of his people. Vanguard layers and even masses participate collectively in the work when they realise that it is the continuity of their daily struggle. La hora de los hornos shows how a film can be made in hostile circumstances when it has the support and collaboration of militants and cadres from the people.\r\n<br>\r\n&quot;The revolutionary film-maker acts with a radically new vision of the role of the producer, team-work, tools, details, etc. Above all, he supplies himself at all levels in order to produce his films, he equips himself at all levels, he learns how to handle the manifold techniques of his craft. His most valuable possessions are the tools of his trade, which form part and parcel of his need to communicate. The camera is the inexhaustible expropriator of image-weapons; the projector, a gun that can shoot 24 frames per second.&quot; —Directors Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino &quot;Towards a Third Cinema&quot;\r\n</p>	large	f

Violence and disease, the advance guard of civilization: for the Indian, contact with the white man continues to be contact with death. Every legal dispensation since 1537 meant to protect Brazil's Indians has been turned against them. Under every Brazilian constitution they are &quot;the original and natural masters&quot; of the land they occupy, but the richer that virgin land proves to be, the greater the threat hanging over their lives. Nature's very generosity makes them targets of plunder and crime. Indian hunting has become ferocious in recent years; the world's greatest forest, a huge tropical zone open to legend and adventure, has inspired a new &quot;American dream.&quot; Men and business enterprises from the United States, a new procession of conquistadores, have poured into Amazonia as if it were another Far West. This U.S. invasion has inflamed the avarice of Brazilian adventurers as never before. The Indians die out leaving no trace, and the land is sold for dollars to the new interested parties. Gold and other plentiful minerals, timber and rubber, riches whose commercial value the Indians are not even aware of, recur in the reports of each of the few investigations that have been made. It is known that the Indians have been machine-gunned from helicopters and light airplanes and inoculated with smallpox virus, that dynamite has been tossed into their villages, and that they have been given gifts of sugar mixed with strychnine and salt mixed with arsenic. The director of the Indian Protection Service, named by the Castelo Branco dictatorship to clean up its administration, was himself accused, with proof, of committing forty-two different kinds of crimes against the Indians.

US aid &quot;saved the day&quot; for the ruling Generals; the process also &quot;turned the U.S. into a kind of unilateral IMF, overseeing every aspect of Brazilian economic policy.&quot; &quot;In almost every Brazilian office involved in administering unpopular tax, wage, or price decisions, there was the ubiquitous American adviser,&quot; the new US Ambassador discovered in 1966. Once again, the US was well-positioned to use Brazil as a &quot;testing area for modern scientific methods of industrial development&quot; (Haines), and therefore has every right to take credit for what ensued. Under US guidance, Brazil pursued orthodox neoliberal policies, &quot;doing everything right&quot; by monetarist criteria, and &quot;strengthening the market economy&quot; (Skidmore). The &quot;economic miracle&quot; proceeded in parallel with the entrenchment of the fascist National Security State, not accidentally; a regime that could not wield the knout could hardly have carried out measures with such a deleterious impact on the population. <br>\r\n<font style="color:#cc0000">The President announced in 1970 that repression would be &quot;harsh and implacable,&quot; with no rights for &quot;pseudo-Brazilians.&quot; Torture became &quot;a grisly ritual, a calculated onslaught against body and soul,&quot; Skidmore writes, with such specialties as torture of children and gang rape of wives before the family. The &quot;orgy of torture&quot; provided &quot;a stark warning&quot; to anyone with the wrong thoughts. It was a &quot;powerful instrument,&quot; that &quot;made it even easier for Delfim and his technocrats to avoid public debate over fundamental economic and social priorities&quot; while they &quot;preached the virtues of the free market.&quot;</font> The resumption of high economic growth, by these means, made Brazil &quot;again attractive to foreign private investors,&quot; who took over substantial parts of the economy. By the late 1970s, &quot;The industries dominated by local capital in Brazil [were] the same industries where small businesses flourish in the United States&quot;; multinationals and their local associates dominated the more profitable growth areas, though with the changes in the global economy, about 60 percent of foreign capital was then non-US (Peter Evans). </p>	large	f

One of those groups, formed after the first Reagan inauguration, was the U.S. Council for World Freedom (USCWF), headed by Major General John Singlaub. \r\n<br>\r\nThe USCWF quickly became the U.S. branch of the World Anti-Communist League (WACL). The USCWF began building support for the Reagan policy of aiding not only the Nicaraguan Contras but RENAMO and UNITA in southern Africa and rightist Islamic fundamentalists in Afghanistan. Singlaub informed Central Intelligence Agency director William Casey and National Security Council staff of his actions and operated with their assent, if not under their direction.\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/waclconvention1981.jpg" style="padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;"><br>\r\n<span class="caption"> A World Anti-Communist League Convention</span>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the early USCWF financial backers was Joe Coors (Yes, of Coors Beer), according to two former USCWF treasurers. Coors shared Reagan's enthusiasm for the Contras despite early indications of the unsavory background of certain Contra leaders and reliable reports of Contra acts of brutality. The Contras were originally known as the 15th of September Legion. Their earliest training came from Argentinian military intelligence, which ran death squads in that country and sponsored a Latin American conference of death squad leaders in 1980. That death squad network was also the Latin American branch of WACL. In 1982, Argentinian intelligence worked with Moon's Unification Church and fugitive Nazi Klaus Barbie to establish a Nazi-style state in Bolivia.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="The NFF"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="column-fill:balance">\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/reagancontra1985.jpg" style="height:20%;padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;"><br>\r\n<span class="caption"> Ronald Reagan with a Contra leader (and CIA agent), Adolfo Calero, in 1985</span><br><br>\r\nReliable international monitoring groups have reported that the Contras killed thousands of peasants, slaughtered cattle, and created terror in an apparent effort to undermine the confidence of the Nicaraguan people in their government. Contra project officers in Washington created a covert financial support apparatus run by Oliver North and his superiors. A public financial support apparatus coordinated by Singlaub was also tied into the White House, Joe Coors worked with both fundraising networks. Joe Coors was one of the boosters of a big fundraising dinner for the Contras in 1985 arranged by the Nicaraguan Refugee Fund at which Reagan was the keynote speaker. The Fund was set up by the Contras' fundraising arm and promoted by a public relations firm whose founder had long-standing Central Intelligence Agency links.\r\n<br>\r\nCoors also contributed to the Nicaraguan Freedom Foundation (NFF), established by the Moon-owned Washington Times. Board members of NFF included Jeane Kirkpatrick, William Simon, and Michael Novak. Simon and Novak were on the board of PRODEMCA, which also funneled money to the Contras. Jeane Kirkpatrick and her husband Byron Kirkpatrick publish a quarterly magazine, World Affairs, which has published an article endorsing the use of death squads. The Christian Broadcast Network (CBN), whose Regent University is supported by the Coors Foundation and has Holly Coors on its board, was one of the largest donors to the Contra cause, giving millions of dollars to the Contras in Central America (the Nicaraguan Freedom Foundation funds went there as well). Christian Broadcast Network owner Pat Robertson held a telethon on May 30, 1985 to raise funds for the Contras.\r\n<img src="/mapimages/contracamp1984-1.jpg" style="padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;"><br>\r\n<span class="caption"> Contra Camp, 1984</span><br>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="The Conservatives"></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/contracamp1984-2.jpg" style="padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;"><br>\r\n<span class="caption"> Contra Camp, 1984</span><br>\r\nAnother active Contra support group was Citizens for America, cochaired by Lewis Lehrman and Holly Coors. Citizens for America was formed in coordination with the White House in 1983 to build support for Reagan's programs. In 1985, it organized a tour of twenty Contras to two hundred congressional districts to lobby for Contra funding. Lehrman also organized a June 2, 1985 meeting in Angola that brought together the Nicaraguan Contras, the South African-backed UNITA leaders, and similar rightist groups from around the world.\r\n<br>\r\nOther Coors-funded groups that have actively supported the Contras include the Heritage Foundation, the Free Congress Foundation, and The Conservative Caucus (TCC). TCC has said for example, "The Conservative Caucus has advocated a strategy of victory over Communism in Nicaragua from the very beginning&#8212;and we will continue to press for aid to the Contras, de-recognition of the Sandinistas, and a new government, friendly to the United States."\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/olivernorthtcchowardphillips1981.jpg" style="height:40%;padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;"><br>\r\n<font class="caption">Oliver North with The Conservative Caucus's Howard Phillips, this photo was used in fundraising appeals.</font><br><br>\r\nJoe Coors also became involved with Oliver North in the clandestine Contra support networks. On May 21, 1987, he told Congress that he met with Central Intelligence Agency director William Casey, on June 18, 1985, to offer support for the Contras. (Coors knew Casey from the 1980 presidential campaign and had been funding the National Strategy Information Center with which Casey had worked.) Casey directed Coors to Oliver North, who got Coors to buy a small airplane for the Contras.

Heritage in 1985 "donated" $100,000 to the Institute for North. South Issues (INSI), an Oliver North-connected conduit. From INSI, $80,000 of the money went to the account of LC., Inc., a North-Spitz Channell conduit to the Contras. The $100,000 came from a private con-tributor contacted by Roy Godson, a National Security Council consultant and director of the National Strategy Information Center. A Congressional report noted, "The true objective of this 'grant' was disguised in correspondence between (Richard) Miller (as Treasurer of INSI) and Edwin J. Feulner (as president of Heritage Foundation) with whom Godson had met previously."<br>\r\nThe "private" aid that Coors and others provided to the Contras appeared to violate U.S. neutrality laws which state: <br><i>\r\nWhoever, within the United States, knowingly begins or sets on foot [sic) or provides or prepares a means for or furnishes the money for, or takes part in, any military or naval expedition or enterprise to be carried on from thence against the territory or dominion of any foreign prince or state, or of any colony, district, or people with whom the United States is at peace, shall be fined not more than $3,000 or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\r\n</i><br>\r\n In fact, several other private individuals supplying aid to the Contras have been prosecuted. Spitz Channell and members of Civilian Military Assistance, for example, have been indicted for the violation of federal laws. In 1985, Jack Terrel, a leader of a civilian commando unit that aided the Contras and himself indicted in the Iran-Contra scandal, revealed that "Coors brewery is one of the Contras' biggest supporters."\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/joecoorsandednoble.gif" style="padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;"><br>\r\n<span class="caption"> Ed Noble and Joseph Coors, founders of the Heritage Foundation</span>\r\n\r\n</p>	large	t

It\r\nwas ten years before the Jesuits returned; but they did so in 1653 in\r\nthe towering person of Antonio Vieira. Vieira was a Brazilian-born\r\nJesuit who had risen to be the close confidant and confessor of Dom\r\nJoao IV of Portugal. He was famous for the brilliance of his sermons\r\nat a time when the pulpit was the most potent medium of communication.\r\nVieira had been entrusted with secret diplomatic missions in Europe,\r\nand his was the most influential voice in shaping Portuguese foreign\r\npolicy. It came as a surprise when this powerful man suddenly vowed\r\nto take up missionary field work, and actually sailed for the backwater\r\nof the Amazon.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAntonio Vieira was appalled by the conditions he found in Maranhao\r\nand Para. He preached fiery sermons against expeditions to 'rescue' or\r\n'ransom' Indians which were really slaving expeditions and condemned\r\nany settlers who kept Indian slaves: 'All of you are in mortal sin; all\r\nof you live in a state of condemnation; and all of you are going directly\r\nto Hell!' But his eloquence was wasted on colonists who had no\r\nintention of giving up any Indians and who were constantly clamouring\r\nfor more native labor. After a journey up the Tocantins, Vieira\r\nreturned to Portugal and persuaded the vacillating king to enact new\r\nlegislation (1655) against Indian enslavement. The Jesuits were entrusted\r\nwith the task of bringing the Indians from the interior by peaceful means\r\nand establishing them in mission villages under their control. Five years\r\nof euphoric activity ensued for the Jesuits. The Fathers accompanied\r\nexpeditions up all the main tributaries of the lower Amazon and far up\r\nthe Rio Negro, and they had soon 'descended' some 200,000 Indians into 54 mission aldeias. The tribes came willingly, impressed by the\r\nreputation of the Jesuits and by their promises of material prosperity\r\nand religious enlightenment. The descents were, however, murderous\r\ndeceptions. Many Indians died of alien diseases during the voyages\r\ndown to Belem; but the missionaries consoled themselves that these\r\nvictims of their misguided policy had at least received baptism before\r\ndying. Once settled in aldeias near Portuguese towns, the Indians were\r\nexposed to constant demands for their labor. Crowded into these\r\nsettlements, they were particularly vulnerable to smallpox and measles,\r\nepidemics of which occurred with dismal regularity. The Jesuits could\r\nnot reconcile the fundamental contradiction that stifted any royal wish\r\nfor humane treatment of the Indians. The small European colonies in\r\nBrazil could not prosper without native labor and could not ward off\r\nattack by hostile tribes or rival colonial powers without docile native\r\nauxiliaries. The settlers knew that they could make the Indians work\r\nfor them only by force; and in the impoverished Amazon they were\r\ntoo poor to afford African slaves. \r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="17 Years"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="background-color:white;padding:7px;margin-top:160px;'">\r\n\r\n&emsp;\r\nLife in this region depended on river\r\ntransport and on fish and game, gums, fruits, and resins extracted from\r\nthe forests. For such activities local Indians were far better than\r\nimported Africans. The Jesuits deluded themselves that the Indians in\r\ntheir missions would become loyal Christian subjects of Portugal. But\r\nthey knew in practice that they were condemning them to forced labor\r\nand rapid destruction from disease, demoralization, malnutrition and\r\nsocial disruption.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nVieira himself performed two missions of which he was proud. In 1659 he undertook an embassy to the tribes of Marajo Island, who were known collectively as Nheengaiba (Tupi for 'incomprehensible\r\nlanguages'). These tribes had successfully resisted repeated Portuguese\r\npunitive expeditions, usually by disappearing into the labyrinth of\r\nchannels on their island. Forty thousand of them now surrendered,\r\naccepting Vieira's assurances that Portuguese attitudes had changed\r\nwith the new law of 1655. The Jesuits established themselves on Marajo,\r\nwhere their huge cattle ranches prospered, to the envy of the colonists\r\nand eventually of the government in Lisbon. In 1660 Vieira made a\r\ndifficult journey to the remote Ibiapaba hills on the border between\r\nMaranhao and Ceara. He confronted the remnants of the north-eastern\r\nIndians who had fled there after the departure of the Dutch.

Colonists who had hoped to make their fortune in the Amazon were defeated by the difficult conditions and climate.\r\nAs they saw their riverside clearings fail, they vented their frustration\r\non the jesuits, pious busybodies who seemed to be thwarting their\r\nsupply of fresh Indian labor. Their fury erupted in May 1661 with a\r\nrising in Sao Lur do Maranhao against the Jesuit Fathers. Vieira and\r\nmost of his men were arrested and shipped off to Portugal. A new law\r\nof September 12 1663 installed lay <i>repartidores</i> in Indian villages to\r\noversee the allocation of men to work on settlers' holdings. It was\r\nseventeen years before Vieira was able to influence a new king, Pedro\r\nII, to reinstate the jesuits in full control of Indian aldeias and to forbid\r\nall forms of Indian slavery. During those years irreparable damage had\r\nbeen done to the Indians under Portuguese rule. \r\n</p>	large	f

861	Puebla	1978	1979	mex2	church		<p class="entry columns">\r\n&emsp;\r\nOn December 12, 1977, the Pope Paul VI formally summons the III Latin American General Episcopal Council, which did not take place on the appointed date due to his death on August 6, 1978. It is John Paul II who summons it again for the beginning of 1979. <br>\r\nEleven years after Medellin, the Latin American Bishops gathered again in Puebla de los Angeles, México. The III General Latin American Episcopal Council was inaugurated by John Paul II, on January 27, 1979 at the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe. The meeting took place from January 28 to February 13, with 356 participants, to meditate about the theme: <i>Evangelization in the present and in the future of Latin America.</i>\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nChristian-Marxist dialogue also held an interesting place within the ecumenical debates of this period, in particular that developed by the group Exodo in Costa Rica, and that between Christians and Sandinistas in Nicaragua. The latter resulted in a seminar on "Christian Faith and the Sandinista Revolution", organized by the Central American university and the Central American historical institute in Managua in 1979, where Father Amando López coordinated sessions that involved the participation of both Sandinista commanders and Christian theologians.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nBut the main and richest theological debate of the 1970s arose from the preparatory document for the third Latin American bishops conference, in Puebla, Mexico, in 1979. According to historian Enrique Dussel, "this is, perhaps, the most important theological debate that has taken place in the history of Latin American theology" since the one started by Las Casas and Sepúlveda in Spain during the period of colonial domination. Puebla, with newly elected Pope John Paul II in attendance, was the second bishops conference to develop and approve the church's preferential option for the poor and place itself squarely and openly in solidarity with workers and campesinos and all Latin Americans who were living under repression. The theology of liberation was fully affirmed by most bishops, as well as ecumenical solidarity. The debates were lively and open and watched closely by the new pope and the Vatican as a section of conservative bishops close to military regimes and those thought to be part of Opus Dei, the growing reactionary movement in the Roman Catholic Church which had originated in Spain, attempted to return to old roles where church and state were close and interdependent. That part of the church played the part of chaplaincy to the established order, following unquestioningly the oppressive regimes.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOf particular concern to the Puebla meeting was the place of Indigenous Peoples throughout the region and especially in Guatemala, <img src="/mapimages/puebla1979pope.jpg" class="floatright">\r\nBolivia, Nicaragua and other countries where Indians existed in large numbers and were among the poorest and most exploited of all Latin Americans.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nPuebla came at a critical time for Protestant and Catholic churches to work together for justice and peace as a priority of the churches' mission. Once again, Protestant observers were invited and one working group on dialogue for communion and participation dealt specifically with the issue of ecumenism. In the Puebla document concrete references to the practice of ecumenism appear, in several forms: "practical social", "spiritual", "doctrinal", "biblical", "dialogue" and "witness" ecumenism.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nPuebla, however, established clear limits for ecumenical dialogue. According to the document, ecumenism should take place at the institutional level and for many bishops this was the only form of ecumenical manifestation allowed. In that perspective, ecumenism emanating from the grassroots was marginalized, ignored and often rejected because it "overstepped" those boundaries.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe pontificate of John Paul II has been marked by a determination to reinsert the Church and its beliefs into elements of human life from which secularism sought to expel them. (John Paul is ably assisted in this endeavor by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, whom the Pope appointed head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.  Ratzinger authored a two-part refutation of liberation theology in the 1984 <i>Instruction on Certain Aspects of the "Theology of Liberation"</i> and the <i>Instruction on Christian Freedom and Liberation</i> that came out two years later.) John Paul's main enemy, since his election in 1978, has been modern secularism. For the Pope, liberation theology is part of this secularism.\r\n</p>	large	f

The Dominican Republic advertisement section in the New York Times of January 28, 1973, has a heading entitled &quot;Industrialists Dream of Chances Like These,&quot; featuring the low, low wage rates, running between 25 and 50 cents an hour. The ad stresses the role of the law in fixing hours and wages and allowing the free import of foreign technicians. There is no mention of any trade unions, but employers will properly read between the lines that unions have been broken and pacified (with the assistance of George Meany and the AFL-CIO). Of special interest is the regular use of government troops and police to break up independent unions. The agricultural union Sindicato Unido, which operated the fields now owned by G &amp; W was broken by police action in 1966 and 1967, and a number of its leaders, including the union lawyer Guido Gil were arrested and killed by the forces of law and order. \r\n<br>&emsp;Another major foreign enterprise, Falconbridge Nickel, also successfully broke a union with army and police assistance in 1970. A Wall Street Journal report of September 9, 1971 states that &quot;when a union attempted to organize construction workers at a foreign-owned ferronickel mill project last year, Mr. Balaguer sent in the army to help straighten things out. While the soldiers kept order, the contractors fired 32 allegedly leftist leaders...The strike was broken in eight days.&quot; Matters had not changed much in the mid-70s. An ad hoc human rights group that visited the Dominican Republic in 1975 reported that &quot;working people have been prevented by nearly every conceivable means from forming and joining trade union organizations.&quot; <strong>A union organizing effort in the G &amp; W free trade zone in the mid-1970s was broken with the help of the police in arresting, jailing, and deporting labor organizers, and with the use of &quot;troops in full combat gear armed with submachine guns&quot; to break up organizing meetings.</strong> Flannery states that:\r\n<i>\r\n&quot;Officials of the Dominican labor ministry told organizers that—contrary to the paper guarantees of the republic's laws—workers would not be allowed to form a union in the industrial free zone.&quot;\r\n</i>\r\nOn the matter of labor unions, the 1977 State Department Human Rights Report has the following &quot;information&quot;: \r\n<i>\r\n&quot;Labor unions are permitted to function and numerous labor unions exist including some associated with opposition parties, but under some government controls.&quot;</i> That exhausts that topic.\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;In containing unions and rendering them docile the Dominican elite has had the steadfast support of the top echelons of the AFL-CIO, which has long cooperated closely with the CIA and international business firms in this unsavory operation. Its arm CONATRAL actually helped destroy the pro-labor Bosch regime in 1963 and has steadily supported its totalitarian and anti-labor successors.&quot;' Presumably their blind hatred of Communism and radicalism in general has led Meany and his close followers to sell out systematically the interests of labor in the Dominican Republic and in other U. S. satellites. \r\n<br>&emsp;Meany and some other labor bosses actually have a more direct interest in the pacification of labor in the Dominican Republic. Meany, his number two man Lane Kirkland, Alexander Barkan, director of COPE, the AFL-CIO political arm, and Edward J. Carlough, president of the sheet metal workers, all are stockholders in the 15,000 acre Punta Cana resort and plantation in the Dominican Republic. In order to clear the ground for this enterprise designed for the Beautiful People a large numbers of squatters were evicted by the army.</p>\r\n<p style="font-size:small;"><i>Pictured</i>: A soldier of the Mobile Training Team, U.S. Special Forces, uses an AN/PRC-10 radio to keep in touch with other members of the patrol during a training exercise with forces in the Dominican Republic in 1971.</p>\r\n	large	f

The  bishops recognized one protestor as an aid to Pinochet and saw another drop a blank  detention order. \r\n<br>\r\nThe Permanent Committee of the Episcopal Conference was swift in issuing a  condemnation of the incident. The declaration expressed the bishops’ “indignation” at  the protests and affirmed that the punishment for perpetrating violence against a  bishop is automatic excommunication; however, the declaration went further and for  the first time expressed a candid criticism of the regime itself. The bishops asserted  that the abuses taking place were not spontaneous or accidental but were rooted in the  very nature of military government.\r\n<br>\r\n<span class="blockquote" style="font-style:italic;">\r\nThe actions that we denounce and condemn are not isolated.

It was to be a revolution, many said, and even the Communist Party of El Salvador described it as such: “the beginning of the bourgeois-democratic era, the triumph of the capitalist class over the feudal and semi-feudal landowning oligarchy. The bourgeoisie finally had come to power.“\r\n<br>\r\nThe Osorio government gradually developed a three-pronged strategy that would remain the framework of rule in El Salvador for decades to come: <i>developmentalism</i>—the creation of conditions to permit the expansion and modernization of the economy; <i>reformism</i>—the policy of adjusting existing political and social structures to keep the system one step ahead of its own contradictions; and <i>repression</i>—reserved for those who could not be coopted and wanted more than ameliorative change.\r\n<br>\r\nAs the first order of business, Osorio repealed the anti-industry laws of the Martinez era and replaced them with strong incentives to invest in new sectors. The power and size of the state bureaucracy was greatly expanded, as new offices were set up to coordinate the development of commerce, industry and mining, and taxes were imposed on coffee exports to feed new areas of investment. .\r\nA modern infrasmicture began to talte shape, with the building of the giant Fifth of November dam on the Lempa River, to provide cheap electrical power to the cities. And a highway running the length of the Paciﬁc coast opened new lands to the production of cotton and cattle. The peasants displaced by these new activities were a source of cheap labor  to industry. bent on competing with imported manufactured goods for the small national market.\r\n<br>\r\nBut as plans for industrializing the country got under way the modernizers retained the memory of l932—of the alliance of workers and peasants that channeled discontent into organized rebellion. The labor movement in El Salvador was alive and growing, and The Salvodorean Committee for Trade Union Organizing (Spanish Acronym: CROSS) had become a force that the Osorio government set out to tame.\r\n<br>\r\nThe Constitution of 1950 reflected both the strength of the working class and the government‘s attempt to coopt it. The new constitution granted, at least on paper. the right to organize unions within very strict limits; the right to strike; the right to a minimum wage, social security beneﬁts and subsidized housing. None of these rights were extended to the rural sector. which remained unchanged in every respect. That was part of the deal with the agro-front, the price for their support of modernization.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="caption" style="width:440px;position:relative;left:550px;style="background-color:white;"">The Vice President Richard M.

Based on a concept of harmonious cooperation between labor and capital, and boosted by government favors, a new federation was established by 1958, called the General Confederation of Salvadorean Unions (CGS). This was intended to compete with the more radical General Workers Confederation (CC-TS) formed a year earlier.\r\n<br>\r\nThe process of modernization gradually created more layers between the very rich and the very poor in El Salvador. The rapid expansion of the state bureaucracy stimulated the growth of a middle class; industrial growth began to enlarge the small, still mainly artisan working class. The modernizers needed a vehicle to legitimize their rule and integrate these new sectors of society into their "revolution."<br>\r\nColonel Osorio had lived in Mexico and admired the ability of the PRI (Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party) in drawing diverse sectors into its ranks. El Salvador's PRUD—the Revolutionary Party of Democratic Uniﬁcation—was Osorio's brainchild. He made it the political vehicle of the modernizing alliance, running military candidates for president and using the military command structure as a\r\npolitical machine.‘ \r\n<br>\r\nOsorio and the modernizers also proceeded to replace the decades-long reign of tyrants with the stability of a single-term presidency and smooth succession every ﬁve years. They allowed small opposition parties to emerge, representing dissident factions of the oligarchy that wanted a return to civilian rule.‘ But they were no match for the massive machinery of the PRUD. In 1956 Osorio's hand-picked successor, Colonel josé Maria Lemus, was elected on the PRUD ticket by an overwhelming margin.\r\n<br>\r\nThe small reforms of the modernizers never replaced the need for repression. In 1952 Colonel Osorio outlawed the CROSS after brief and unsuccessful efforts to coopt its leadership. But the repression in this period was still subtle and selective. It was always justified by “a great conspiracy, a communist coup discovered in the nick of time," wrote one of its victims, the baker and labor leader, Salvador Cayetano Carpio, arrested and tortured in 1952.\r\n<br>\r\nBut Colonel Lemus was less sophisticated and more corrupt than Osorio. His term coincided with a sharp downturn in the economy: worldwide recession reached El Salvador in the late 1950s, sending coffee prices to rock bottom and disappointing the popular hopes inflated by the fanfare of 1950. And then came Cuba—that unexpected island of revolution that burst upon the scene in 1959. Castro's victory provoked demands for harsher measures from the Oligarchy. Students began protesting in the streets; workers began organizing Action Committees in their unions.<br>\r\nOn October 26, 1960, Colonel Jose Maria Lemus was informed by army couriers that his presence no longer served the national interest. Junior officers had decided to act.\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f

542	The United Provinces of Central America	1823	1823	hon1	redstar	A BRIEF HISTORY OF CENTRAL AMERICA, LYNN V. FOSTER	<div class="page" data-title="another page"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\n&emsp;\r\nMexico, in its declaration of independence, had annexed all\r\nthe provinces of New Spain within its newly formed empire. Central\r\nAmerica understood the threat behind Mexico’s request that it proclaim\r\nitself part of the empire. Without the resources to offer resistance,\r\nCentral America accepted its neighbors’ troops in Guatemala City\r\nunder the authority of a Mexican governor, Brigadier General Vicente\r\nFilísola, <i>pictured</i>. The Central Americans, fortunately, benefited from many provisions\r\nin the new Mexican constitution, including the abolition of all\r\nslavery and tribute and the establishment of free trade.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nCentral America was not of a single mind in regard to Mexican annexation,\r\nalthough many interest groups and regions found it an attractive\r\noption. Most town councils favored it and elected deputies to represent\r\nthem in the Mexican congress; the respected José del Valle was the most\r\nillustrious of the deputies. Many conservatives favored annexation,\r\nbecause they thought it would preserve their privileges just as they had\r\nbeen under Spain—only the crown now was worn by a creole. Many\r\nbelieved that Mexico’s homegrown emperor, Agustín Iturbide, would\r\nprovide the central authority necessary to avoid the provincial conflicts\r\nthat threatened to divide the isthmus. Others hoped that Mexico’s\r\nwealth would help to strengthen the Central American economy.\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe issue failed to touch the vast majority of Indians and rural poor.\r\nYet some groups in the western highlands, such as the Quichés of\r\nMomostenango, actively supported annexation and were loyal to\r\nFilísola, who permitted the rebel Mayans to control local affairs. \r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/carvicentefilisola.jpg">\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nCosta\r\nRica proclaimed its neutrality on the matter. A few important cities,\r\nTegucigalpa and Granada among them, and the most ardent liberals,\r\nsuch as Pedro Molina of Guatemala and Miguel José Arce of El Salvador,\r\nopposed annexation. San Salvador, daring to declare its intention of\r\nattaching itself to the United States rather than to Mexico, was quickly\r\noccupied by the Mexican army in San Salvador to quell any chance of\r\ninsurrection.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nFilísola successfully annexed El Salvador in 1823, but Mexico was in\r\nno position to sustain the fight for Central America and could not even\r\npay the troops stationed in Guatemala City, much less force compliance\r\nin Granada or faraway Costa Rica. Iturbide proved more of a buffoon\r\nthan a monarch. Soon after the Salvadoran uprising, the emperor was\r\ndeposed. Not knowing what else to do, Governor Filísola convened a\r\nCentral American congress that was mandated by the Mexican constitution.\r\nOn July 1, 1823, the congress convened and immediately declared\r\nits independence from Mexico. Chiapas, the only province to dissent,\r\nremained part of Mexico. To get rid of the unpaid Mexican troops in the\r\ncapital, however, the residents of Guatemala City had to raise thousands\r\nof pesos to pay for their trip north.\r\n<br>&emsp;With the overthrow of Iturbide, Central America declares itself independent of Mexico as the United Provinces of Central America (also known as\r\nthe Federal Republic of Central America). \r\nAt a meeting of the Constituent\r\nAssembly held in 1824 Jose Simeon Canas y Villacorta, a deputy from\r\nEl Salvador, pleaded that without further delay it should be made clear\r\nthat ‘our enslaved brothers should be declared free citizens’.53 The\r\nmeasure actually adopted decreed that slaves could no longer be born in\r\nCentral America and established a fund to promote slave manumission.\r\nOver the next two decades the United Provinces broke up into the\r\nseparate states of Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and\r\nCosta Rica. None of the successor states sought to challenge the\r\nabolitionist provisions of 1824 and the subsequent development of a\r\nmodest cash crop sector in agriculture did not depend on slave labour.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="another page"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOnce independent, Central America was confronted with true independence—\r\nand the tug of disparate interests. With no king and an empty\r\ntreasury, the former colony faced the choice between unity and division\r\ninto five autonomous states: Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras,\r\nNicaragua, and Costa Rica. (Belize theoretically remained part of\r\nGuatemala even though the British occupied its coastal regions;\r\nPanama was part of Colombia.)\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nFilísola’s congress, transforming itself into a constitutional assembly,\r\noptimistically declared the new sovereign nation of the United\r\nProvinces of Central America under the banner of God, Unity, and\r\nLiberty. This vote reflected the hopefulness and experimentation that\r\nmarked the first years of the republic. Full of the idealism of the\r\nEnlightenment, the Central Americans engaged in lively debates about\r\nthe best direction for the future. Most recognized that the individual\r\nprovinces were too small and too weak economically to survive as sovereign\r\nstates, so the fractious liberals and conservatives seriously negotiated\r\nwith one another to avert such a fragmentation of the isthmus.\r\nDespite the Conservative Party majority in the assembly (46 to 13\r\nLiberals), a liberal constitution was agreed upon on November 22,\r\n1824, based on the federal principles of the United States of America.\r\nAnd to put some money in the treasury, a five-million-peso loan was\r\nnegotiated with a bank in London.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n&emsp;\r\nOne problem confronting a unified government was the distrust the\r\nprovinces had for the vested interests in Guatemala City. This was such\r\na persistent issue that the federal capital was eventually relocated to San\r\nSalvador. A further serious obstacle to representational government was\r\nthe imbalance in population and physical size of the member states.\r\nGuatemala, already despised for its concentration of power, accounted\r\nfor 40 percent of the population. When the federal congress convened in\r\n1825, the number of delegates for each province reflected the problem:\r\n18 for Guatemala, 9 for El Salvador, 6 each for Honduras and Nicaragua,\r\nand 2 for Costa Rica. The Senate, with two members from each state,\r\nequalized matters, but the preponderance of Guatemalans in the legislature\r\nremained a problem in the view of the more provincial areas.\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/unitedprovincesofcentralamericamap-green.png">\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;\r\nBoundaries between states were redrawn, and in some instances the\r\nchanges were peacefully accomplished. Guatemala gave Sonsonate, part\r\nof its fertile Pacific coast, to El Salvador, and contemplated carving a\r\nsixth state called Los Altos out of its western highlands (SEE map below).\r\nLos Altos would have had Quetzaltenango, the second largest\r\ntown in Guatemala, as its capital, and thus a population of more than\r\n200,000, greater than any state other than Guatemala. The final decision\r\nto create Los Altos, however, was delayed from fear this Quiché\r\nregion might secede (which it did anyway, but only for a brief period,\r\n1838 to 1839). Costa Rica officially separated from Nicaragua and\r\nannexed Nicaragua’s region of Guanacaste, including the Nicoya\r\nPeninsula. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="another page"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/cararcedelvalle.jpg" style="width:100%;"><br>\r\n\r\nOther state borders, however, were disputed well into the\r\n20th century, especially in the areas of British interests, such as the\r\nMosquitía and Belize. Part of the problem was not simply territorial, but\r\nalso ignorance about the geography of the isthmus. Although demarcations\r\nbetween the member states were not all resolved and the imbalances\r\nwere barely corrected, the federation proved that important\r\ncompromises could be made, just as they were in the drafting of the\r\nconstitution.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nWhile the constitutional assembly was attempting to shape the future of\r\nCentral America, more provincial interests continued to fester. Except in\r\nCosta Rica, long-held antagonisms between elite families and neighboring\r\ntownships rose to the surface and the contenders vied with one\r\nanother for power under the new government. Comayagua, the capital,\r\nand Tegucigalpa, the bustling economic center, fought for control of\r\nHonduras; the fighting did not cease until they agreed to alternate the\r\ncapital between them every other year. León, a liberal Nicaraguan city\r\nand home to the second university in Central America, bitterly fought\r\nGranada, the aristocratic economic stronghold. In Guatemala, the\r\nexpanding center of the western highlands, the conservative interests in\r\nQuetzaltenango undermined liberal ones in Guatemala City. Everywhere\r\nturf battles as old as the early struggles among conquistadores were\r\nfueled by the lack of an established central authority.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe weakness of the national government was starkly revealed in\r\nNicaragua when war broke out between León and Granada, a conflict\r\nthat would not truly be resolved until a neutral capital was created at\r\nManagua in 1857. The federal government wished to send a negotiator,\r\nbut El Salvador wanted to send in its own troops in clear defiance of the\r\nconstitution. El Salvador acted unilaterally and, unfortunately for the\r\nfederal government, successfully brought about a temporary peace in\r\nJanuary 1825.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nTaxation, too, was an ongoing problem. The national congress would\r\nnot grant the government enough authority to function without fiscal\r\nreliance on the states. The tobacco monopoly, for example, was given to\r\neach province to administer on the condition that a percentage of the\r\nrevenues would be paid to the federal government; most states\r\nneglected to comply. Deeply suspicious of the central authority, the\r\nstates seemed willing to bankrupt it. And it became transparently clear\r\nthat most congressional deputies held the narrow interests of their\r\nhome states, not those of the republic, dear.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe congress also maneuvered to control the first presidential election.\r\nBy promoting numerous candidates, it hoped to take a majority away\r\nfrom the certain victory for statesman José del Valle, <i>pictured right</i>. With the election\r\nthen given to congress to resolve, the conservative deputies planned to\r\nchoose the candidate they could most easily control. Valle won a popular\r\nmajority nonetheless, but the congress disqualified the vote on a questionable\r\ntechnicality. The congressional choice was Manuel José Arce, <i>pictured left</i>, a\r\nsupposed liberal from El Salvador, who garnered more votes from the\r\nconservatives than did their conservative colleague Valle. The first election\r\nof the United Provinces of Central America defied the popular will,\r\nand the first president of Central America was compromised before he\r\nwas even sworn into office. The republic was in the hands of the deputies\r\nand local interests, and the federation was beginning to look more like a\r\nloose confederation of small independent nations than a single republic.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n	large	f

Current debt to private banks amounts to $200 million in interest alone, but though payment is largely suspended, the international lending institutions keep the funds flowing. &quot;Costa Rica has lost the ability to determine its own economic future,&quot; the San Jose journal Mesoamerica concluded in mid-1988, reporting that real wages had fallen 42 percent in the preceding five years, as prices increased while subsidies for food and medicine were reduced or eliminated. The infant mortality rate had risen sharply in certain areas, primarily because of the economic crisis and increasing hunger, according to the University of Costa Rica's Institute for Health Research. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) demanded further cuts in social spending, lowering of the minimum wage, and cutting of government employees, &quot;thus jeopardizing what had been one of the most enlightened social service programs in Latin America,&quot; Mesoamerica reports. Once self-sufficient in agriculture, Costa Rica is now importing staples as it shifts to largely foreign-controlled exports, including export crops, in line with traditional IMF-World Bank-USAID directives, a familiar recipe for disaster in Third World countries. &quot;Arias's pro-big business economic strategy,&quot; COHA observes, may turn large numbers of once self-sufficient farmers to wage laborers on agribusiness plantations while profits are largely expatriated, &quot;a major change of philosophy in a country that has had a strong state-directed welfare orientation.&quot;</p>	large	t

592	The Beginning of Jose Figueres	1948	1948	incos2	power	Killing Hope by William Blum	<p class="entry columns3">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/josefigueres.jpg" style="width:100%;"><br>\r\nAn anti-communist revolution led by Jose Figueres, <i>pictured</i>, and supported by United States is successful in Costa Rica. Figueres, three-time president of Costa Rica, later admits to his connections with CIA. If ever the CIA maintained a love-hate relationship, it was with Jose Figueres, three times the head of state of Costa Rica. \r\n<br> On the one hand, Figueres, by his own admission in 1975, worked for the CIA "in 20,000 ways … all over Latin America" for 30 years. "I collaborated with the CIA when we were trying to topple Trujillo," he divulged, speaking of the Dominican Republic dictator.\r\n<br> On the other hand, Figueres revealed that the Agency had twice tried to kill him. He did not elaborate, although he stated at the same time that he had tried for two years to get the Bay of Pigs invasion called off. This may have precipitated one or both of the assassination attempts. \r\n<br> The CIA also tried to overthrow the Figueres government. In 1964, the first significant expose of the Agency, <i>The Invisible Government</i>, disclosed that: \r\n<span class="blockquote" style="font-style:italic;">in the mid-1950s CIA agents intruded deeply into the political affairs of Costa Rica, the most stable and democratic republic in Latin America. Knowledgeable Costa Ricans were aware of the CIA's role. The CIA's purpose was to promote the ouster of Jose (Pepe) Figueres, the moderate socialist who became President in a fair and open election in 1953.</span>\r\n<br> Figueres remained in office until 1958, in his first term as president; he had headed a liberal junta in the late 1940s. \r\n<br> The Agency's "major grievance was that Figueres had scrupulously recognized the right of asylum in Costa Rica&mdash;for non-Communists and Communists alike. The large influx of questionable characters complicated the agency's job of surveillance and forced it to increase its staff."\r\n<br>\r\nThe CIA's problems with Figueres actually went somewhat deeper. Costa Rica was a haven for hundreds of exiles fleeing from various Latin American right-wing dictatorships, such as in the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, and Figueres was providing groups of them with material and moral support in their plans to overthrow these regimes. To Figueres, this was entirely in keeping with his antitotalitarian beliefs, directed against the left as well as the right. The problem was that the dictators targeted for overthrow were all members in good standing of the United States' anti-Communist, "Free-World" club (The American attitude toward Trujillo was later modified). Moreover, Figueres had on occasion expressed criticism of the American policy of supporting such dictatorships while neglecting the economic and social problems of the hemisphere.\r\n<br>\r\nThese considerations could easily outweigh the fact that Figueres had established his anti-Communist credentials, albeit not of the "ultra" variety, and was no more a "socialist" than US Senator Hubert Humphrey. Although Figueres spoke out strongly at times against foreign investment, as president he was eminently accommodating to Central America's <i>bêtes noires</i>, the multinational fruit companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f

In 1986, Reagan dismantled the allowance of imported small gifts an remittances to Cuban relatives. In 1988, Reagan put up restrictions on subsidiaries making shipments to and from Cuba, which had been mainly through third party countries.\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout Reagan's term, the US Treasury was ordered to crack down on previously overlooked aspects of the embargo, including examining what special visa holders were doing in Cuba. Of particular interest were journalists, scholars, and lawyers. Numerous cases and lawsuits were filed to send the message that Cuban relations and trading were going to be strictly monitored.\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 further restricted trade: Third party nations and foreign US-owned or operated subsidiaries were again forbidden from trading with Cuba, boats belonging to third party nations were disallowed from docking in the United States for 180 days after trading with Cuba, and the treasury department got the right to prosecute any violators, with fines of $1M for corporations, and $100K for civilians. It also  reinstated the denial of American aid to countries that provided assistance to Cuba.\r\n<br>\r\nThe CDA was met with a resounding disdain in the international community, leading to a UN resolution directed at the United States expressing a deep concern for the US extraterritorial legislation. The list of countries opposed to the CDA included Canada, Britain, France, Japan, Spain, Mexico, and Brazil. Despite its overwhelming unpopularity, the CDA was not be revoked.\r\n<br> \r\nFollowing the election of Bill Clinton, small reforms were passed, but nothing that really affected the overall policy. It wasn't until the passage of the Helms-Burton Act in March of 1996 that a big change was initiated in the Cuban sanctions. The act included the following:\r\n<br>• International Sanctions against the Castro Government. Economic embargo, any non-US company dealing economically with Cuba can be subjected to legal action and that company's leadership can be barred from entry into the United States. Sanctions may be applied to non-U.S. companies trading with Cuba. This means that internationally operating companies have to choose between Cuba and the US, which is a much larger market.\r\n<br>• United States opposition against Cuban membership in international financial institutions.\r\n<br>• Television broadcasting from the United States to Cuba.\r\n<br>• Authorization of United States support for democratic and human rights groups and international observers.\r\n<br>• U.S. policy towards a transition government and a democratically elected government in Cuba. (Sanctions to be lifted when these things occur)\r\n<br>• Protection of property rights of certain United States nationals.\r\n<br>• Exclusion of certain aliens from the United States, primarily senior officials or major stock holders, and their families, of companies that do business in Cuba on property expropriated from American citizens. To date, executives from Italy, Mexico, Canada, Israel, and the United Kingdom have been barred.\r\n<br>• Legislative Branch granted power to override an Executive Branch cancellation of the embargo.\r\n<br>• Prohibits recognition of a transitional government in Cuba that includes Fidel or Raul Castro\r\n<br>• Prohibits recognition of a Cuban government that has not provided compensation for U.S. certified claims against confiscated property, defined as non-residential property with an excess of $50,000 value in 1959.\r\n<br>\r\nThe US continues to fund terrorist and anti-Cuban organizations today. </p>	large	f

A judicial investigation was initiated, headed by Judge Atilio Ramirez. He accused General Medrano, the death squad organizer and US favorite, and rightwing leader Roberto d'Aubuisson of hiring the assassins, and shortly after, fled the country after death threats and an attempt on his life. In exile, Judge Ramirez reports that the Criminal Investigation Section of the National Police did not arrive until four days after the assassination and "did not provide the Court any data or evidence of an investigation into the crime." The same was true of the Office of the Attorney General. Judge Ramirez concludes that "it is undoubtedly the case that from the very beginning, they were involved in a kind of conspiracy to cover up the murder." The security forces were not entirely inactive, however. They did raid the Legal Aid Office of the Archbishopric, removing all files bearing on the assassination, including testimony implicating the military. None of this evidence has surfaced, and neither the US government nor the press seems much interested. The Director of the Church Legal Aid Office also fled the country after death threats and warnings that his children and wife would be killed. The offices were repeatedly raided by security forces, and human rights leaders have been harassed and murdered, also with little notice in the press here, apart from reiteration of government lies that they were "guerrillas."\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p class="caption" style="text-align:left;">Moments after he is shot, frantic worshipers tend to their fallen priest, Archbishop Romero.</p>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\nAn excerpt of Archbishop Romero's last Sermon: <br>"<i>I would like to make a special appeal to the men of the army, and specifically to the ranks of the National Guard, the police and the military. Brothers, you come from our own people. You are killing your own brother peasants when any human order to kill must be subordinate to the law of God which says, "Thou shalt not kill." No soldier is obliged to obey an order contrary to the law of God. No one has to obey an immoral law. It is high time you recovered your consciences and obeyed your consciences rather than a sinful order. The church, the defender of the rights of God, of the law of God, of human dignity, of the person, cannot remain silent before such an abomination. We want the government to face the fact that reforms are valueless if they are to be carried out at the cost of so much blood. In the name of God, in the name of this suffering people whose cries rise to heaven more loudly each day, I implore you, I beg you, I order you in the name of God: stop the repression.\r\n<br>\r\nThe church preaches your liberation just as we have studied it in just as we have studied it in the holy Bible today. It is a liberation that has, above all else, respect for the dignity of the person, hope for humanity's common good, and the transcendence that looks before all to God and only from God derives its hope and its strength.</i>"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n	large	f

543	The first major peasant rebellion in El Salvador occurs.	1833	1833	els1	redfist	THE HISTORY OF EL SALVADOR by Christopher M. White	<strong>1833</strong> <i> The first major peasant rebellion in El Salvador occurs. It is led by the Indian Anastasio Aquino.</i>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/anastasioaquino.jpg" style="float:left;height:160px;width:126px;padding: 0px 7px;">\r\nThe conversion of El Salvador into an oligarchic state and an agro-export\r\neconomy based on private property was by no means a smooth\r\nprocess. It depended as much upon the exercise of class and ethnic violence\r\nas it did upon the entrepreneurial zeal and political confidence so celebrated\r\nin the opening years of the new century. Indeed, it was in El\r\nSalvador that Liberalism had first been challenged by Indian resistance in\r\nthe aftermath of Central American independence; in 1833 the popular\r\nuprising led by Anastasio Aquino had required the deployment of troops\r\nfrom outside the province and wide-spread repression before social order\r\nwas restored and the ladino state secured.\r\n<br>\r\nThe Anastasio Aquino revolt of 1833 signified\r\none of the great contradictions of independence in Latin America in general.\r\nIndependence from Spain did not equal Indian independence simply by\r\nvirtue of the action itself. Oppression against Indians now possessed another\r\nelement: the lack of church protection. Whereas one of the only avenues of\r\nprotection for the Indians used to be the Crown, and with the Spanish Crown\r\ngone, the Indian population became subject to further losses in land and life\r\nby the new independence leadership and those that followed. The nationalist\r\nleadership sought to exploit as much land as possible and therefore moved to\r\nprivatize large tracts of land that had been under the protection of the Crown\r\nfor the purposes of continued indigenous usage.\r\n<br>\r\nLabor conditions also became worse under the new leaders, and this more\r\nthan likely provoked the Aquino uprising. Anastasio Aquino and his brother\r\nBlas were indigo workers on a hacienda when Blas was punished via the\r\nstocks. It was well understood that forced labor of Indians was commonly\r\npracticed and this occurred not only on the indigo haciendas but in the regular\r\nSalvadoran army as well. When Indian troops were used to put down a\r\nladino uprising against the government in October of 1832, and ladino-Indian\r\nclashes erupted in San Miguel in January 1833 with massive suppression of\r\nthe Indians by the government, Aquino and his followers decided to rise up\r\nfrom Santiago Nonualco. Aquino’s guerrillas were particularly offended by\r\nforced conscription of Indians fighting for the elite’s cause and their initial\r\nattacks concentrated on liberating the Indian conscripts and their weapons in\r\norder to build a base for a continued battle against the state. Aquino decreed a ban on collecting taxes and debts, all with very severe penalties. He also banned the making and consumption of liquor, a means for sedation and degradation against the large masses in the countryside.\r\n<br>\r\nThe first major battles against government forces were successful and signaled\r\nthe possibility that Aquino’s men might take the capital if they so chose.\r\nHowever, they decided to conquer lesser towns such as San Vicente and Zacatecoluca,\r\nthus giving the military a window of time and space to recover.\r\nWhen marched into San Vicente, he seized a crown from the head of a \r\nstatue of Saint Joseph and placed it on his own head.\r\n Although Aquino took San Vicente twice in February, his movement was quickly\r\nput down at the end of that month, and he was executed in July.\r\n<br>\r\nAquino soon becomes a martyr for the disenfranchised much like the rest of the\r\nheroes of El Salvador’s poor throughout postindependence history. After his\r\nexecution, his severed head was placed in a cage and put on display as a message\r\nto all other potential rebels.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\nFrom Eduardo Galeano's <i>Faces and Masks</i>:\r\n<br><i>The head of Aquino lies in the executioner's basket. \r\n<br>May he rest in war. The chief of the Indians in El Salvador had raised three thousand spears against the robbers of the lands. He got the better of the muskets, which the enemy fired with glowing cigars, and stripped Saint Joseph naked on the high altar of a church. Clad in the cloak of the father of Christ, he proclaimed that Indians would never again be slaves, nor soldiers, nor famished, nor drunk. But more troops arrived, and he had to seek refuge in the mountains.<br>\r\nHis lieutenant, named Cascabel, turned him in.<br>\r\n"Now I am a jaguar without claws or Fangs," said Aquino, when they loaded him with shackles and chains; and he confessed to Fray Navarro that in all his life he had only been frightened by the anger or tears of his wife.\r\n</i><br>\r\n</p>	large	f

His family had been installed in power by President Franklin\r\nRoosevelt, the man who also had made human rights the center piece\r\nof US policy in his Four Freedoms address during World War II. But\r\nRoosevelt had never bothered the Somoza clan with complaints about\r\nhuman rights violations. After all, forty-five years of anti-communist\r\nobedience should have counted for more than a few cases of maltreating\r\nradical trouble makers.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nWhen Somoza finally realized that Carter was serious, he found\r\nhimself in an impossible position. To lift martial law for the purpose of\r\ncontinuing to receive US aid and legitimation would also mean allowing\r\nthe FSLN to have the necessary space to organize throughout the\r\ncountry. To abide by Carter's principles would require Somoza to leash\r\nand muzzle the National Guard; to remove from it the very instruments\r\nby which it had succeeded in terrorizing the population.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nSomoza paid lip service to human rights, hoping that it would appease\r\nthe US ambassador, while at the same time he ordered the Guard to\r\nwipe out Sandinista influence in me poor barrios and the Christian\r\nbased communities where the priests and nuns were applying their\r\nrevolutionary theology. However, the ambassador did not turn the other\r\nway in 1977 and 1978 as Guard members murdered, tortured, raped\r\nand looted their way through the barrios and rural areas. US officials\r\ndenounced the abuses, threatened to cut off aid, and eventually did so\r\nin 1978. Subsequently writing from exile in Paraguay in the 1980s,\r\nSomoza charged: 'Our nation was truly delivered into the hands of the\r\nMarxist enemy by President Jimmy Carter and his administration. I was\r\nbetrayed by a longstanding and trusted ally.' Somoza had a point. Having\r\nlabeled the FSLN communists, and received encouragement and support\r\nfrom right-wing friends in the US military and in Congress for forty\r\nyears, Somoza could not believe that the United States would allow the\r\n'communists' to triumph.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nBut Carter believed he had a mandate to restore US credibility after\r\nthe stains left by the Vietnam War and the revelations of CIA\r\nshenanigans - including its support for corrupt and brutal dictators.\r\nThe era of world politics had passed when American presidents could\r\nwith impunity maintain the Somozas of the Third World as reliable\r\nclients.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="UNITY"></div>\r\n\r\n<table style="margin-top:15px;"><tr><Td width=280 valign=top><img src="/mapimages/nicaragua1978somoza.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">\r\n<span class="caption">Somoza Enters the National Assembly for the Last Time in 1978</span><br><br><br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/nicaragua1978bayareasolidarity.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">\r\n<br>\r\n<span class="caption">Bay Area solidarity Activists in 1978</span>\r\n</td><Td><p class="entry columns2" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-top: -1px;">Since Somoza had no desire to transform himself and his Praetorian\r\nGuard into anything that could conceivably qualify as democracy, he\r\nchose more repression. He thought that by increasing the level of\r\nbrutality the Guard could cow the populace back into obedience. He\r\nwas wrong. The more brutal the Guard's behavior, the more resistant\r\nthe populace grew. As Guard units marched through the barrios, or\r\nrandomly shot poor teenagers and middle-class youth, fear turned to\r\noutrage. People who for decades had accepted the savageries of the\r\nGuard could tolerate no more.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Inside Nicaragua and in the United States, the anti-Somoza forces\r\ncoalesced. Illiterate peasants and local merchants in Nicaragua found\r\nthemselves allied in the struggle against Somoza with exiled dish\r\nwashers in Houston and University of California students. Some became\r\nguerrillas, while others served as lobbyists, pamphleteers, or fund raisers\r\nin Washington. A group of well known professionals and business\r\nexecutives formed 'Los Doce', a group of twelve reasonable and\r\nresponsible moderates who appealed to middle-class opinion throughout\r\nthe world to join in with money and moral support to oust the dictator\r\nand his hated Guard.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;In January 1978, an event occurred that galvanized the fragmented\r\nanti-Somoza opposition. Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, the dynamic editor\r\nof <i>La Prensa</i>, Managua's leading daily, was assassinated. The popular\r\nChamorro had openly published demands for Somoza's removal, and\r\ncalled for broad national unity. Although lacking direct proof, most\r\nNicaraguans assumed Tachito had ordered the slaying. Chamorro, hardly\r\na leftist, had criticized the FSLN 's radical rhetoric, but the Sandinistas,\r\nnevertheless, joined other anti-Somoza elements, including labor unions,\r\nin organizing mass protests, strikes and demonstrations in response to\r\nChamorro's murder. By mid-1978 the Church had added its weight to\r\nthe growing demand that Somoza resign.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;The US government was in the throes of a decisive policy debate.\r\nPresident Carter faced a choice: Somoza, a flagrant rights violator; or\r\nthe FSLN, regarded in intelligence and diplomatic circles as communists,\r\nor, at best, independent leftists friendly to Castro.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;'Another Cuba' in Central America was deemed unacceptable, but\r\nthe continuation of Somoza rule appeared dubious. National Security\r\nAdviser, Zbigniew Brzinski, feared that by applying human rights criteria\r\nto Nicaragua, the United States would strengthen the revolutionaries.\r\nSince the Guard was loyal to Somoza, not the Nicaraguan Constitution,\r\nTachito's removal would lead to its disintegration, Brzinksi believed.\r\nThe only armed force then remaining would be the FSLN. The human\r\nrights activists inside the administration downplayed the Sandinista\r\nthreat and emphasized to the president the importance of maintaining\r\nconsistency on human rights. Carter compromised between the competing ideological wings of his administration.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p></td></tr></table>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="WAR"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="height:580px;font-size: 1.1em;">\r\n&emsp;Reversing nearly a century of tradition, President Carter asked Somoza\r\nto step down as a way of ending the civil war, while retaining intact the\r\nNational Guard, whose loyalties should logically rum from Somoza to\r\nits next benefactor, the United States. It was not an act of idealism, but\r\nrather a realistic judgment on the part of the president. US intelligence\r\nreports agreed that the tide had turned in Nicaragua and that the\r\ndictator's days were numbered. But Carter's decision came too late for\r\nthe national security apparatus to save the Guard. The action on the\r\nbattlefields had ensured the Sandinistas their rightful place as heads of\r\nState.<br>&emsp;\r\nThe battlefield included the very center of government in Managua.\r\nOn 23 August 1978, eleven months before Somoza fled and the Guard\r\ncollapsed, Sandinista soldiers dressed in Guard uniforms arrived in army\r\ntrucks at both entrances of the National Palace, where Somoza's\r\nlegislature convened. Using their best imitation of Guard officer speech,\r\nthey deceived the troops stationed at the doors and other posts. Once\r\ninside, the Sandinistas held captive Somoza's friends, allies and even\r\nfamily members. For Tachito it was supremely humiliating.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nA demoralized Somoza yielded to the Sandinistas' demands for the\r\nrelease of the Nicaraguan glitterati: $500,000 in exchange for safe\r\nconduct from the palace to the airport, where the captors would be\r\nflown to Cuba, plus the release of fifty-nine political prisoners. Even\r\nNational Guard officers winced when Somoza caved in. Morale sank\r\nfor a short time.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nTo revive the fighting spirit of his men, Somoza ordered unprecedentedly\r\nvicious levels of reprisals against the revolutionaries. Inspired\r\nby their palace victory, the Sandinistas called for uprisings. In Matagalpa.\r\naccording to the Nicaraguan press, 'armed youths in rebellion' took\r\nover thirty city blocks. The Guard responded with artillery, armored\r\nvehicles and heavy machine-gun fire to retake the neighborhood. On\r\nAugust 27, the Catholic Church called upon Somoza to resign as 'the\r\nonly way to end the current political violence'.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn the final days of August the depressed Tachito regained the\r\nruthlessness that had made him the scourge of the nation. He purged\r\nGuard officers who had criticized his weakness in bargaining with the\r\nrebels. Charged and found guilty of conspiring to overthrow the\r\ngovernment were eighty-five Guardsmen, including twelve officers. As\r\nfor the 'communists and subversives', his name for all revolutionaries,\r\nSomoza told his generals to show no mercy. Sandinisus or suspected\r\nsympathizers were rounded up, tortured, interrogated and then killed.\r\nThe Guard carried out fishing expeditions in the barrios, targeting\r\nespecially the youth. Thousands of men and women were arrested and\r\nshot simply because they were young. Instead of submitting, the public\r\nwere spurred to uncontainable rage.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="MUCHACHOS"></div>\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/nicaragua1979resistance.jpg" style="padding:7px;column-span: all;width:99%;">\r\n<p class="entry" style="height:350px">\r\n&emsp;While the human rights advocates and the national security hawks\r\ndebated policy in Washington, the Guard's ferocity claimed the attention\r\nof the world's media. And the Sandinistas, feeling the public pulse,\r\nstruck. On 7 September 1978 guerrilla units descended from the\r\nmountains to launch a major offensive, attacking and holding parts of\r\nfive major cities. Several thousand Sandinistas took part in the offensive,\r\nsending the Guard reeling.

They fought with weapons\r\nstolen from the Guard, sticks, stones and home-crafted Molotov cocktails. Faced with the wrath of the people, the Guard did not flee, but counterattacked with artillery and aeria1 bombing. When the smoke\r\nfinally cleared and the Guard regained control, the bodies of young\r\nboys and girls were strewn across the makeshift barricades and trenches.\r\nCommercial and residential areas, schools and churches, looked like\r\nCoventry after days of Axis bombing during World War II. Those\r\nedifices that remained structurally in tact bore the scars of bullets and\r\nshells.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;The neighborhood of Monimbo, in the city of Masaya, rose up and\r\nwith home-made weapons and rocks held off the heavily armed troops,\r\nthen suffered the retaliation. 'We fought against the Guard to save our\r\nlives,' recalled Ernesto Rodriguez Zelaya, a Monimbo mechanic. 'We\r\nrealized that after the [Guard's} &quot;mopping up&quot; operation life wasn't\r\nworth anything. Whoever stayed home would be killed! It was easier\r\nfor us to grab a rifle and fight with the muchachos than stay home where\r\nwe would be just a target for the Guard. So it was the repression that\r\nmade us fight, because we didn't want to die.'\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn February 1978, Monimbo residents rose again, fought with unbelievable\r\ncourage, using paving stones from Somoza's own factory as\r\nweapons, and then faced the renewed vengeance of the Guard.\r\nBut even after the continued bombing and shelling of the area, the\r\nMonimbo dwellers refused to submit. The Guard could not regain\r\ncontrol.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe behavior of the Monimbo populace dramatized a larger reality,\r\none that even jaded members of US intelligence could not escape: the\r\nvast majority of Nicaraguans were prepared to endure immense pain\r\nand suffering to rid themselves of the Somoza family and their Guard.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nTachito understood the people's loathing and responded accordingly.\r\nHe ordered his air force to bomb and strafe guerrilla-held cities. Even\r\nafter the FSLN had retreated, the air force continued to bomb, to\r\nensure that the populace would get the message. When the bodies were\r\ncounted, the Red Cross announced that over five thousand had perished\r\nfrom Esteli, Masaya and Leon alone. A further 10,000 were missing;\r\n15,000 were wounded; 30,000 were homeless.

On June 9 the National Guard\r\nbegan intensive bombing and strafing of Monimbo, 'the pissed off\r\nbarrio', as it became known. Following the bombing, a column of\r\nSherman tanks led Guard foot soldiers through the Sandinista controlled\r\nneighborhoods to retake portions of Masaya.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe guerrillas beat a strategic retreat, but returned unexpectedly three\r\ndays later and retook most of the city. For two weeks the battle raged,\r\nblock by block. 'The Guard didn't push us out: a Sandinista officer\r\nreported, 'because they didn't receive reinforcements, nor did we take\r\nthem out since we didn't have any ammunition.'\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOn June 24 Guard officers and men abandoned their Masaya\r\ncommand post, using hundreds of political prisoners as a shield to cover\r\ntheir retreat. The Sandinistas were in undisputed control of the city,\r\ntwenty miles south of Managua. Somoza spent his days in the bunker,\r\nbuilt on top of a Managua hill overlooking the Intercontinental Hotel.\r\nOne June evening he met members of the media in an 'off the record'\r\nsession. One reporter, nevertheless, recorded the conversation. Why\r\nwas he bombing his own people, destroying Nicaraguan property, he\r\nwas asked. 'What do you know about underdevelopment?' he slurred,\r\nshowing the effects of a day of drinking. 'My people are a bunch of\r\nlazy, stupid, underdeveloped assholes.'\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn late June, Tachito ordered his bombers to drop 500 pounders on\r\ndensely populated Managua neighborhoods. The Sandinistas, who had\r\ntaken the poor barrios from the Guard, immediately retreated to Masaya,\r\nbut the muchachos who survived the bombings continued to snipe at and\r\nambush the Guard in the capital. The US ambassador demanded that\r\nSomoza resign, hoping that it was still not too late to save the Guard\r\nexcept for its most notorious officers. Apart from unwavering support\r\nfrom the Israeli government - of which Somoza had been a loyal supporter - and a few cohorts among the remaining Latin American dictators, Tachito was isolated.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="POWER"></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/fslnflag.jpg" style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0; max-width: 1020px; clip: rect(0px,1020px,660px,0px);z-index:-1;">\r\n<p class="entry">\r\n<table>\r\n<tr><td bgcolor="white" width="330" valign="top" style="padding:9px;">\r\n\r\n&emsp;\r\nHe knew the war was over, but nevertheless ordered his air force to\r\ncontinue bombing.

Without\r\nSomoza's presence, there was nothing to hold the Guard together.\r\nOverwhelmed and demoralized, the once invincible National Guard\r\ncollapsed. Some units surrendered to FSLN commanders, others fled\r\nas one or in ragtag fashion to borders north and south.

Somoza had made fundamental errors in\r\njudgment. His tactics had alienated even the wealthy, who had for\r\ndecades accepted the caprices of his family rule.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe Somozas had accumulated more than 5500 million during their\r\ndynastic rule. They possessed one fifth of Nicaragua's arable land and\r\nmore than one hundred and fifty businesses. In addition, the family had\r\naccounts and assets in the United States and Europe that were believed\r\nto be more than double what they owned in Nicaragua. Somoza believed\r\nthat as long as the United States was interested in maintaining its\r\nhegemony, the US government would protect him. Tachito's contempt\r\nfor his own countrymen and women was so great that it did not occur to him that Nicaraguans could play a role in determining the fate of\r\ntheir nation.</p>\r\n</td></tr></table>	large	t

The violence is expressed toward the disappeared, the prisoners, the tortured, the exiles, the lack of freedom of the press, etc. ... it is not only with the attacks against the rights of persons that we must deal. We must analyze also, in all the dimensions of this reality, the deep structural causes which generate these conflict situations. For that, the struggle for the dignity of the individual must consider society as much as the individual in all which has to do with the development of the rights of the people.\r\n<br>\r\n&quot;But this same continent and these same human beings live, besides, in the hope of making their own history. And to this immense task, where I humbly include myself, we take no more than our own hands and great faith.\r\n<br>\r\n&quot;To those of you also involved in this struggle on behalf of the poor, I want to bring you the image of this deeply absorbing situation and its significance for world peace.\r\n<br>\r\n&quot;Latin America does not see itself in the same way, but finds itself caught between an economic-political system and an international social system in profound transformation. Its image of violence reflects the violence of our contemporary world. Its injustices are bound up within an unjust international system, a system whose mechanisms, in the words of John Paul II, 'are mechanisms encountered impregnated not with an authentic humanism, but with materialism producing an international standard with the rich ever richer at the expense of the poor ever poorer'.\r\n<br>\r\n&quot;It is necessary to create the conditions that permit displacing the mechanisms which secure the domination of one country over another. I want to affirm, together with our Latin American pastors in the meeting at Puebla, that in the ability to live together, '... all human beings hold the common good as fundamental, consistent with the ever more fraternal realization of common dignity which does not use some persons as tools for the benefit of others, and that all be disposed to sacrifice for some particular good ends'. This common dignity necessarily implies the existence of liberty.\r\n<br>\r\n&quot;And for us liberty is that inalienable capacity that all humans alike have at their disposal.\r\n<br>\r\n&quot;This is the capacity that permits the building of communion and participation which encourage human beings to relate fully with the world, with their brothers and sisters and with God.\r\n<br>\r\n&quot;I see with concern that this new international system, marked as it is by the existence of great multinational corporations, is far from increasing participation and improving channels of expression for the majority. What is essential are new constructs that allow political participation, eliminating the distance between the governors and the governed, that support the privileges of minorities, and do not hold on to the old, the known and worn-out structures of injustice.&quot;</i></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f

Sharp increases in military assistance to Honduras followed the buildup of United States troops and equipment in Honduras. In 1983 United States forces began a series of large- scale maneuvers in Honduras that not only provided joint training for United States and Honduran forces but also allowed the administration of Ronald W. Reagan to skirt congressional limits on military aid to that country and the Contras. Throughout the 1980s, the United States also built or improved military-related installations such as airfield, barracks, and radar stations. \r\n<br>\r\nIn February 1983, the United States and Honduras conducted a joint military exercise called Big Pine, which was the largest of its kind ever held in Honduras. A total of 1,600 United States military personnel and 4,000 Honduran soldiers participated in exercises designed to help Honduras improve its deployment techniques and logistical support in the field. United States Army elements provided mobility for Honduran forces and logistics and communications assistance. United States Navy elements included two landing ships and two landing craft. United States Air Force personnel participated in the coordination of landing and air supply operations. A number of training personnel, mostly from the United States Army, remained in the country to train the Honduran army in infantry tactics. Also during the exercises, a sizable radar installation staffed by over fifty United States Air Force technicians was placed south of Tegucigalpa. \r\n<br>\r\nThe number of United States advisers increased further in mid-1983 when the United States and Honduras approved a new training agreement as an amendment to the 1954 military assistance agreement. The two countries constructed a military training facility, near Puerto Castilla on the Caribbean coast, at a cost of some US$250,000. The primary purpose of this facility, called the Regional Center for Military Training (Centro Regional de Entrenamiento Militar—CREM), was to train Salvadoran ground forces, although Hondurans also received training. The center initially had about 125 United States Army Special Forces personnel, raising the total number of trainers in the country to approximately 270 in July 1983. \r\n<br>\r\nAlthough CREM closed in 1985, United States military advisers remained. Between 1983 and 1993, the United States and Honduras have carried out an almost continuous string of joint military maneuvers on Honduran soil. To facilitate the maneuvers and strengthen Honduras's military infrastructure, the Honduran government has built a network of roads, improved ports, and constructed additional airfields. \r\n<br>\r\nBetween August 1983 and February 1984, United States forces carried out Big Pine II, a considerably more extensive military exercise than the earlier Big Pine maneuvers, involving up to 5,000 United States military personnel. Extensive naval maneuvers involved two United States Navy aircraft carrier task forces, another task force led by the battleship U.S.S. New Jersey, and a landing by the United States Marines on the Caribbean coast during portions of the exercises. The purpose, according to a senior United States official, was to demonstrate the ability of United States military forces to operate in Central America and to persuade the Sandinista government of Nicaragua to desist from fomenting insurrection in the region. </p>\r\n\r\n<i>Photo: Puerto Castilla. 1983.

That was then the beginning of this war that Reagan invented and mounted and financed and directed: the Contra War. About which he continually lied to the people, helping the United States people to be the most ignorant people around the world. I said ignorant, I don't say not intelligent. But the most ignorant people around the world about what the United States does abroad. <font style="color:#cc0000">People don't even begin to see — if they did, they would rebel.</font>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, he lied to the people, as [George W.] Bush lies to the people today and as they push on, thinking that the United States is above every law, human or divine. And we took the United States, Reagan's United States, his government to court, the World Court. I was Foreign Minister at that time here in Nicaragua. I was responsible for that. And the United States government received the harshest sentence, the harshest condemnation ever in the history of world justice. In spite of the fact that the United States since the early 1920's has been proclaiming to the world that one of the proofs of its moral superiority as compared to other countries around the world is the fact that it abides by the international law and was obedient to the world court when the United States was brought to the world court in Nicaragua and received the condemnation that the United States failed to heed the sentence and they still owe Nicaragua; by now, [it] must be between 20,000 and $30,000 million. At the time when we left government that the damages caused by that Reagan war was over $17 billion, and this, according to very moderate estimators of damage, people from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, people from Harvard University and from Oxford and from the University of Paris basically this is the team that was pulled together to estimate the damage. \r\n<br>\r\nThe United States was ordered to pay for the damage. Bush never even wanted to talk to me about it. I said, &quot;Well, let's have a meeting so that you comply with your sentence of the court.&quot; He said to me in two different letters that there was nothing to talk about.\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Reagan did damage to Nicaragua beyond the imaginations of the people who are hearing me now. The ripple effects of that; criminal murderous interventions in my country will go on for what, 50 years or more.&quot; \r\n<br>\r\n<font align="right">—Miguel d'Escoto on the death of Ronald Reagan in 2004</font></p>	large	f

In October the leader of the Radical Civic Union, Raul Aifonsin, wins the presidency with 52 percent of the vote; it is the first time the Peronist movement has been defeated in clean elections. He is sworn into office on December 10. The new Congress nullifies the autoamnesty. Alfonsin creates a presidential commission of leading members of the society to investigate human rights violations and asks the courts to press charges against Videla, Massera, and other leaders of the dirty war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;width:600px;">\r\n<b>An Excerpt from Massera's 2010 obituary:</b><br>\r\nKnown by some historians as the “grand orator” of the dictatorship for his captivating rhetoric, Mr. Massera operated the Naval Mechanics School, a clandestine prison known as ESMA where thousands of political prisoners were tortured over the six years of the regime, which collapsed in 1983.\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Massera was “the most sinister character in our history because he was a serial assassin, without exaggeration,” Osvaldo Bayer, an Argentine historian, said in a radio interview. “He took advantage of his uniform for power and money.”\r\n<br>\r\nA federal court convicted him in 1985 of crimes against humanity and sentenced him to life in prison. Then, in 1990, President Carlos Menem granted him and other coup leaders amnesty in what Mr. Menem called a gesture of reconciliation.\r\n<br>\r\nBorn in Buenos Aires in 1925, Mr. Massera was educated at Argentina’s elite naval academy and became a midshipman in 1946. He rose to the rank of full admiral and commander in chief under Mrs. Perón in 1974.\r\n<br>\r\nIn that post, he pressed Mrs. Perón to fight urban guerrilla groups, persuading her to push for laws to beef up security and to stop the insurgents at any cost. He was ruthless in enforcing measures to maintain public order.\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Massera ran the military arm of the dictatorship the first two years. As head of the navy, he was also in control of the prison camp at ESMA in Buenos Aires. The admiral visited the camp often, overseeing torture, which included rape. The military tortured most of its prisoners and dumped them, dead or alive, into the River Plate from airplanes. Mr. Massera studied philology as a young man and obsessed over the use of language. “He had a messianic oratory, a sonorous oratory,” said Marguerite Feitlowitz, a literature professor at Bennington College who has written a book about Argentina’s dictatorship. “His speeches were very evil and very polished.” In a speech in 1972 to officers who had been chosen to carry out the death flights, Mr. Massera said, “Death will not triumph here, because all of our dead, each and every one, died for the triumph of life.”\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mr. Massera was convicted of dozens of counts of murder, torture and robbery, he was unrepentant. “Nobody has to defend himself for having won a fair war,” Mr. Massera said after the trial. “The war against subversive terrorism was fair.” Despite Mr. Menem’s pardon, Mr. Massera was arrested in 1998 on charges of having stolen babies born to political prisoners, a crime not covered by the amnesty. His ill health kept him out of prison. In 2005, the Supreme Court, under the administration of President Néstor Kirchner (who died on Oct. 27), declared the amnesties unconstitutional. But the court, confirming Mr. Massera’s dementia, suspended all cases against him, as well as extradition requests from Germany, Spain, Italy and France. Those countries had sought him for the killings of their citizens during the dictatorship.\r\n<br>\r\n<b>NYTIMES</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n	large	f

Their deaths prompted a number of journalists to explore the network of &quot;Private&quot; - and ostensibly independent - religious, secular New Right and paramilitary organizations working with the contras. By 1984, the most prominent of the &quot;private&quot; donors were Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network, Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, Thomas V. Posey's Civilian Military Assistance and related paramilitary groups, Louisiana State Representative Louis Jenkins' Friend of the Americas, and the Knights of Malta led by J. Peter Grace. At the center of the &quot;Private Aid Network&quot; was John Singlaub, head of the World Anti-Communist League. Singlaub had been tapped as one of the Reagan administration's key National Security Council Coordinator for private Contra fundraising.

In January 1986, Christian Democrat leader Vinicio Cerezo was elected President and said he had &quot;the political will to respect the rights of man,&quot; but it didn't take long to find out that his political will was irrelevant in the face of Guatemala's well-oiled military machine. Hopes for change were dashed when Cerezo announced he would not nullify the &quot;self-amnesty law&quot; declared on the eve of his election by General Oscar Mejia Victores, <i>pictured</i>, establishing amnesty for all past military offenses committed from General Efrain Ríos Montt's coup in 1982 through the 1986 elections (<i>Pictured,</i> Ríos Montt).\r\n<br>&emsp;<span style="background-color:yellow;">\r\nAlthough Ronald Reagan's State Department asserted &quot;there has not been a single clear-cut case of political killing,&quot; within months of Cerezo's inauguration opposition leaders attributed 56 murders to security forces and death squads, while Americas Watch claimed that &quot;throughout 1986, violent killings were reported in the Guatemalan press at the rate of 100 per month.&quot;</span> Altogether, Americas Watch says, tens of thousands were killed and 400 rural villages were destroyed by government death squads during Reagan's term in office.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nColonel D'Jalma Dominguez, former army spokesman, explains: &quot;For convenience sake, a civilian government is preferable, such as the one we have now.

Equally poor nations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America have lower violence levels. The explanation for Guatemala's high level of violence probably is rooted in cultural and sociological factors unique to Guatemala. Guatemala is distinguished from other Central American nations by the duality of its culture where a wealthy ladino minority lives side by side with an impoverished Indian majority largely marginalized from national political and economic life. . . . The use of violence to settle disputes of almost any nature is accepted in Guatemala's indigenous culture.\r\nThe plantation system which historically generated Guatemala's exports and wealth has relied on Indian labor to function. . . .<br>&emsp;\r\nFear of revolution stems from the Arbenz period when the first political efforts to involve peasants and Indians in national life began in earnest. . . .

Death squad activity and human rights abuses drastically increased shortly after. \r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nDuring the 1960s and the 1970s the Pentagon continued to be the main source of foreign support for the Honduran armed forces. On the economic front, the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) provided grants and loans for the construction of hydroelectric dams highways and rural roads, as well as for farm credit, agroexport pro motion, public administration, grain marketing, private enterprise promotion, and public administration. Bolstered by U.S. funds and supplies, nongovernmental organizations like CARE, the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD), and Partners of the Americas began operations in Honduras.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nPrior to the late 1970s there was little U.S. pressure for Honduras to shift from military to civilian rule. Suddenly, however, U.S. hegemony in Central America was threatened by the Sandinista challenge to Anastasio Somoza of Nicaragua and the rise of leftist movements in Guatemala and El Salvador. Bordering all three countries, Honduras gained new strategic importance for Washington and\r\nsoon came to occupy a pivotal position in U.S. policy toward Central America.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe outlines of U.S. foreign policy became apparent soon after the\r\nSandinista victory in July 1979. Secretary of State for Inter-American\r\nAffairs Viron Vacky presented a major policy report to Congress in\r\nSeptember 1979 in which he pointed out that "Honduras' geographical position gives it a key role in preventing regional conflicts and potential infiltrations." Even before the ouster of Somoza, however, the\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nCarter administration had begun to pay closer attention to the political stability of Honduras. In 1978 the State Department began Working with the military junta led by Gen. Policarpo Paz to facilitate a\r\ntransition to civilian rule in 1980.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nInstituting a policy that would later be repeated in El Salvador and Guatemala, the Carter administration adopted a dual program  of political reform and militarization. With an election schedule in place\r\nand a promise by the military to cede direct control of the government to the political parties, the United States stepped up its commitment of economic and military aid to Honduras in 1980. To bolster the Honduran military's capacity to patrol the Nicaraguan and Salvadoran borders, the Carter administration loaned the Honduras air force ten Huey helicopters. At the same time the U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) sent a Special Forces team to Honduras to instruct the armed forces in border security operations.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Building It Up"></div>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/honduranmilitaryexercise2.jpg" style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0; max-width: 1060px; clip: rect(0px,1020px,720px,0px);">\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="height: 524px;position: relative;top: 83px;background-color:rgba(255,255,255,.6);padding: 9px;left: -10px;width: 867px;">\r\n&emsp;\r\nThe Carter administration moved quickly to help Honduras adapt to its new geopolitical role. It brokered a provisional agreement in October 1980 to settle the long-running border dispute between\r\nHonduras and EI Salvador. This agreement provided for joint border\r\npatrols and granted the Salvadoran army access to the pockets of disputed\r\nborder territory (known as <i>bolsones</i>) where Salvadoran guerrillas\r\nwere camped. The expanding cooperation between the two armies\r\nhad severe consequences for the thousands of Salvadoran refugees\r\nfleeing into Honduras. In one bloody incident some 600 Salvadorans\r\nwere killed, mostly by Honduran troops, as they attempted to cross\r\nthe Sumpul River into Honduras. Besides taking an active role in the\r\nSalvadoran conflict, the Honduran armed forces were also pressured\r\nby the United States to patrol the Nicaraguan border to prevent the\r\nalleged smuggling of weapons through Honduras into EI Salvador.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe Carter policy of political reform seasoned with generous\r\ndoses of militarization established the foundation for massive injections\r\nof military and economic aid by the Reagan administration. Like\r\nCarter, President Reagan recognized that a civilian government in\r\nHonduras was essential to the credibility of U.S. claims that its main\r\nforeign policy goal in Central America was to shore up democratic\r\ngovernments. Under Reagan the strategic significance of Honduras\r\nincreased as the country became the launching ground for the Nicaraguan\r\ncontra war. In the early 1980s the role assigned to Honduras\r\nin the regional crisis expanded from containment to counterrevolution.\r\n4 The U.S. diplomatic corps, swelling to over 1,300, became one\r\nof the largest in the world.\r\nDelineating Washington's expectations of its alliance with\r\nTegucigalpa, Assistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams explained:\r\nOur political objectives for Honduras are clear: to strengthen democracy\r\nand democratic institutions, to elicit full cooperation\r\nagainst nondemocratic forces in the region, to encourage regional\r\ncooperation and solidarity, and to obtain the greatest\r\nHonduran support possible for our objectives in the region and\r\nelsewhere. Our economic objectives must bolster and reinforce\r\nour overall objectives, which can and would be undermined if political\r\nand social progress is not achieved.5\r\nIn the 1980s U.S. foreign policy did succeed in eliciting Honduran\r\ncooperation for its program of counterrevolution and militarization.\r\nDuring the years 1980-89, Honduras received over $1.6 billion in direct\r\nU.s. military and economic aid. Largely as a result of this aid,\r\nHonduras became, as President Suazo had once reminded President\r\nReagan, Washington's "closest ally" in Central America.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nInterdependence between the two countries deepened during th('\r\n1980s. Large sums of U.S. economic assistance kept the economy\r\nafloat, and large allocations of U.S. military aid kept the armed forceH\r\nacquiescent in the face of the "democratization" process and the expanding\r\ncontra presence. For its part, Washington relied on Honduras\r\nfor close cooperation in its war of destabilization against.\r\nNicaragua. Honduras became the base for a U.S. military build-up allowing\r\nthe Pentagon to construct an extensive infrastructure of air\r\nfields, bases, and radar sites in the country.\r\n</p>	large	t

Noriega warned Bush that he had information which could change the course of the 1988 U.S. elections and the CIA backed off, but when Noriega &quot;annulled&quot; Panama's 1989 elections, citing CIA interference, Bush renewed attempts to unseat his one-time ally. \r\n<br><br>\r\nCritics called Bush's failure to support an abortive 1989 coup &quot;indecisive,&quot; but his response to that criticism, the December 1989 invasion of Panama, led to world condemnation.

The bleeding of the New World became an act of charity, an argument for the faith. With the guilt, a whole system of rationalizations for guilty consciences was devised. The Indians were used as beasts of burden because they could carry a greater weight than the delicate llama, and this proved that they were in fact beasts of burden. The viceroy of Mexico felt that there was no better remedy for their &quot;natural wickedness&quot; than work in the mines. Juan Gines de Sepulveda, a renowned Spanish theologian, argued that they deserved the treatment they got because their sins and idolatries were an offense to God. The Count de Buffon, a French naturalist, noted that Indians were cold and weak creatures in whom &quot;no activity of the soul&quot; could be observed. The Abbe De Paw invented a Latin America where degenerate Indians lived side by side with dogs that couldn't bark, cows that couldn't be eaten, and impotent camels. Voltaire's Latin America was inhabited by Indians who were lazy and stupid, pigs with navels on their backs, and bald and cowardly lions. Bacon, De Maistre, Montesquieu, Hume, and Bodin declined to recognize the &quot;degraded men&quot; of the New World as fellow humans. Hegel spoke of Latin America's physical and spiritual impotence and said the Indians died when Europe merely breathed on them.\r\n<br>&emsp;&emsp;\r\nIn the seventeenth century Father Gregorio Garcia detected Semitic blood in the Indians because, like the Jews, &quot;they are lazy, they do not believe in the miracles of Jesus Christ, and they are ungrateful to the Spaniards for all the good they have done them.&quot; At least this holy man did not deny that the Indians were descended from Adam and Eve: many theologians and thinkers had never been convinced by Pope Paul III's bull of 1537 declaring the Indians to be &quot;true men.&quot; When Bartolomé de las Casas upset the Spanish Court with his heated denunciations of the conquistadors' cruelty in 1557, a member of the Royal Council replied that Indians were too low in the human scale to be capable of receiving the faith. Las Casas dedicated his zealous life to defending the Indians against the excesses of the mine owners and encomenderos. He once remarked that the Indians preferred to go to hell to avoid meeting Christians.\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Depiction of Blemmyes, engraving in a 1603 German edition of Sir Walter Raleigh’s Discovery of Guiana, 1595.</strong>\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f

499	The Machete Wielders	2005	2005	pue1	massacre	NACLA: Remembering Filiberto Ojeda Ríos	<table style="position:relative;top:-20px;"><tr><td width="520">\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="font-size:.95em;"><strong>The FBI assassinates 72-year old Filiberto Ojeda Rios, leader of the Boricua Popular Army, Los Macheteros (the Machete Wielders). </strong><br>\r\n&emsp;Ojeda Rios (1933-2005) led a life of revolutionary activity in Puerto Rico as early as 1961, when he first went underground. He was arrested in 1970, after being accused of belonging to armed anti-colonial insurgency groups, but he evaded prosecution by again returning underground. Later, in 1978, he helped found the Ejercito Popular Boricua-Macheteros, also known as Los Macheteros. Notorious for its brazen attacks on U.S. military interests, the guerrillas proclaimed their goal of securing the independence of Puerto Rico through revolutionary action.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;In 1985, the FBI launched raids against independence activists across the island, angering even the local Commonwealth government, which had not been warned in advance. After a dramatic firefight, Ojeda Rios was among those arrested, but was later acquitted. While his acquittal was for charges stemming from his armed resistance to the FBI's arrest attempt—which he claimed was an assassination attempt—the real charges brought by the FBI immediately after the acquittal included seditious conspiracy and charges for the 1983 Wells Fargo bank heist, which the Macheteros publicly took credit for. Ojeda Rios knew that they had been pursuing him since the late 1960s and was clear on the need to protect his life and his organization.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Ojeda Rios returned underground in 1990, causing widespread embarrassment to the FBI. Over the next 15 years, his would be the voice of rebellion and revolution, of social justice, of the working class, and of his ultimate vision of a Puerto Rico emancipated from the dependency and control of U.S. colonialism. His name and figure became legendary; his voice and image repeatedly emerged in the form of videos, voice recordings, and even exclusive TV interviews.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Unrelenting in its pursuit, the FBI sent Quantico's Hostage Rescue Team to attack Ojeda Rios's home in the mountains of Hormigueros in September 2005. Elma Beatriz Rosado, his wife, safely made it out of the home during the firefight that ensued. She witnessed the ambush in which Ojeda Rios was left to bleed to death after an FBI sniper's single bullet wounded him. News reports suggested that agents tampered with the scene, and officials at FBI headquarters discussed portraying the incident as a suicide in order to cover up misconduct.\r\n</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width="75"></td>\r\n\r\n<td width="400" valign="top">\r\n\r\n<p class="bigquote" style="font-size:26px;">\r\n&quot;Puerto Rico has a history that is very heroic and prolific.

The perpetrators were Salvadoran criminals operating under the direction of Luis Posada Carriles and financed in Miami. One of the most notorious international terrorists, Posada had escaped from a Venezuelan prison, where he had been held for the Cubana airliner bombing, with the aid of Jorge Mas Canosa, a Miami businessman who was the head of the tax-exempt Cuban-American National Foundation (CANF). Posada went from Venezuela to El Salvador, where he was put to work at the Ilopango military air base to help organize US terrorist attacks against Nicaragua under Oliver North's direction.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Posada has described in detail his terrorist activities and the funding for them from exiles and CANF in Miami, but felt secure that he would not be investigated by the FBI. He was a Bay of Pigs veteran, and his subsequent operations in the 1960s were directed by the CIA. When he later joined Venezuelan intelligence with CIA help, he was able to arrange for Orlando Bosch, an associate from his CIA days who had been convicted in the US for a bomb attack on a Cuba-bound freighter, to join him in Venezuela to organize further attacks against Cuba. An ex-CIA official familiar with the Cubana bombing identifies Posada and Bosch as the only suspects in the bombing, which Bosch defended as &quot;a legitimate act of war.&quot; Generally considered the &quot;mastermind&quot; of the airline bombing, Bosch was responsible for thirty other acts of terrorism, according to the FBI. He was granted a presidential pardon in 1989 by the incoming Bush I administration after intense lobbying by Jeb Bush and South Florida Cuban-American leaders, overruling the Justice Department, which had found the conclusion &quot;inescapable that it would be prejudicial to the public interest for the United States to provide a safe haven for Bosch [because] the security of this nation is affected by its ability to urge credibly other nations to refuse aid and shelter to terrorists.&quot;<br>\r\n&emsp;As for the 1997 bombings?<br>\r\n&emsp;Cuban offers to cooperate in intelligence-sharing with the Clinton Administration to prevent terrorist attacks have been rejected by Washington, though some did lead to US actions. "Senior members of the FBI visited Cuba in 1998 to meet their Cuban counterparts, who gave [the FBI] dossiers about what they suggested was a Miami-based terrorist network: information which had been compiled in part by Cubans who had infiltrated exile groups." Three months later the FBI arrested, not the terrorists, but Cubans who had infiltrated the US-based terrorist groups. Five were sentenced to long terms in prison. They are now known as the Cuban Five (two have since been released after over a decade in prison).\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="caption"><i>Pictured</i>, Giustino di Celmo holds a portrait of his son, Fabio.</p>	large	f

He is killed in 2004 under mysterious circumstances.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns">The Colombia Plan is officially justified in terms of the &quot;drug war,&quot; a claim taken seriously by few competent analysts. The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reports that &quot;all branches of government&quot; in Colombia are involved in &quot;drug-related corruption.&quot; In November 1998, US Customs and DEA inspectors found 415 kg of cocaine and 6 kg of heroin in a Colombian Air Force plane that had landed in Florida, leading to the arrest of several Air Force officers and enlisted personnel. Other observers too have reported the heavy involvement of the military in narcotrafficking, and the US military has also been drawn in. The wife of Colonel James Hiett pleaded guilty to conspiracy to smuggle heroin from Colombia to New York, and shortly after, it was reported that Colonel Hiett himself, who is in charge of US troops that trained Colombian security forces in &quot;counternarcotics operations,&quot; was &quot;expected to plead guilty&quot; to charges of complicity. The paramilitaries openly proclaim their reliance on the drug business. &quot;The leader of the paramilitaries [Carlos Castano] acknowledged in a television interview that the drug trade provided 70 percent of the group's funding,&quot; correspondent John Donnelly reported in March 2000. This was the first appearance on Colombian TV of Castano, who heads the largest and most brutal of the paramilitary organizations. He claimed to command a force of 11,200 men &quot;financed by extortion and income from 30,000 hectares of coca fields in Norte de Santander.&quot;  But &quot;the US-financed attack stays clear of the areas controlled by paramilitary forces,&quot; Donnelly observes, as have many others. The targets of the Colombia Plan are guerrilla forces based on the peasantry and calling for internal social change, which would interfere with integration of Colombia into the global system on the terms that the US demands: dominated by elites linked to US power interests that are accorded privileged access to Colombia's valuable resources, including oil—quite possibly a significant factor behind the Colombia Plan.</p>	large	f

Even with this qualification, the intelligence assessment eliminated a danger that had been identified by the Mexican ambassador in 1961, when he rejected JFK's attempt to organize collective action against Cuba on the grounds that &quot;if we publicly declare that Cuba is a threat to our security, forty million Mexicans will die laughing.&quot;</p>	small	f

Colombia receives more US military aid than the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean combined. The total for 1999 reached about $300 million, along with $60 million in arms sales, approximately a threefold increase from 1998. The figure is scheduled to increase still more sharply with the anticipated passage of some version of Clinton's Colombia Plan, submitted to Congress in April 2000, which called for a $1.6 billion &quot;emergency aid&quot; package for two years. Through the 1990s, Colombia has been by far the leading recipient of US military aid in Latin America, and has also compiled by far the worst human rights record, in conformity with a well-established and long-standing correlation.<br>\r\nIn theory, &quot;Plan Colombia&quot; is a two-year Colombian government program of $7.5 billion, with the US providing the military muscle and token funds for other purposes, and some $6 billion from the Colombian government, Europe, the IMF, and the World Bank for social and economic programs that Colombia is to prepare. According to non-US diplomats, the draft of &quot;Plan Colombia&quot; was written in English, not Spanish. The military program (arms, training, intelligence infrastructure) was in place in late 1999, but &quot;the Colombian govern-ment has yet to present a coherent social investment program&quot; as of mid-2000, and few governments are &quot;willing to climb aboard what is widely perceived as an American project to clean up its backyard,&quot; by means that are familiar to those who do not choose what has been called &quot;intentional ignorance.&quot;\r\n<br>\r\nThe Colombian Commission of Jurists reported in September 1999 that the rate of killings had increased by almost 20 percent over the preceding year, and that the proportion attributable to the paramilitaties had risen from 46 percent in 1995 to almost 80 percent in 1998, continuing through 1999. The Colombian government's Human Rights Ombudsman's Office (Defensoria del Pueblo) reported a 68 percent increase in massacres in the first half of 1999 as compared to the same period of 1998, reaching more than one a day, overwhelmingly attributed to paramilitaries. Daniel Bland, a human rights researcher who worked in Colombia through most of the 1990s, concludes that in the past three years alone, &quot;more than a million people have been forced from their homes in the countryside, and between 5,000 and 7,000 unarmed peasants have been slaughtered by right-wing paramilitaries.&quot; Of nine people he interviewed for a documentary on human rights in 1997—professors, journalists, priests, human rights workers—&quot;three have since been murdered by paramilitary gunmen; four have fled with their families after receiving death threats.&quot; UNICEF and the Colombian Human Rights Information Bureau CODRES estimate that in June-August 1999 alone, 200,000 more people were driven from their homes.</p>\r\n<p><i>Colombian President Andrés Pastrana (left) and U.S. President Bill Clinton. </i>(Stephen Jaffe)</p>	large	f

Within the year, the president decreed forty-nine law-decrees on a variety of issues, including regulation of the petroleum industry, mi­crofinancing, fishing and land reform. Among these were the new cooperative law that laid the foundation for Venezuela's cooperative explosion, with nearly 300,000 coops now registered by the national government, and a new Land Law that limited private land holdings, and authorized expropriations of fallow land, and its redistribution to organized campesinos.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;On February 4th, 2002, Chavez announced the Presidential Decree 1666 on urban land, opening the door to Venezuelan citi­zens living in the barrios to acquire the title to their homes. This encouraged Venezuelan communities to organize into Urban Land Committees in order to write their community charters and fight for the official deeds to their property.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;But while the law-decrees were empowering some sectors, they were frightening others, Chavez had won the 1998 presidency\r\nwith a large middle-class constituency, who now felt their interests threatened by the new laws and constitution. They foresaw further distribution of resources away from the traditional upper-middle classes in favor of the poor masses. The opposition began to grow and organize. Backed by the traditional oligarchy and the main­ stream media, they began to march daily against the new reforms.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Chavez supporters also took to the streets, organized through community networks known as the Bolivarian Circles. Venezuela's capital, Caracas, is surrounded by poor barrios, which house nearly half of its population of five million in sub-adequate housing and facilities.

In a well-planned operation, 200 masked soldiers under the command of General Romeo Vasquez Velasquez stormed the presidential palace in the middle of the night. The soldiers grabbed President Zelaya from his bed, forced him onto an airplane and flew him into exile. The state television was taken off the air. Electricity to the capital, Tegucigalpa, was cut, as were telephone lines and cell phone service. \r\n<br>\r\nSOA-trained Honduran Army Attorney Col. Herberth Inestroza justified the military coup and stated in an interview with the Miami Herald , &quot;It would be difficult for us, with our training, to have a relationship with a leftist government. That's impossible.'' The crisis in Honduras began when the military refused to distribute ballot boxes for a referendum to determine whether or not a majority of Hondurans want to enter a process to modify their constitution.  In response, President Zelaya fired the head of the military, SOA graduate General Romeo Vasquez Velasquez. The heads of all branches of the armed forces then quit in solidarity with Vasquez. Vasquez, however, refused to step down, bolstered by a Court ruling that reinstated him. Vasquez remains in control of the armed forces.\r\n<br>\r\nVasquez Velasquez, along with Honduran Air Force, General Luis Prince Suazo and other coup leaders, graduated from the SOA.

President Coolidge pressures Guatemala to overthrow President Carlos Herrera, enabling United Fruit to expand.</span>\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nNationalist currents proved even more unpredictable in Guatemala. The\r\nUnionists who overthrew Estrada Cabrera in 1920 had drawn support\r\nfrom a range of political reformers, labor leaders, and conservative\r\nelites. While their more radical plans were never realized, the Unionists\r\ninitiated a decade-long political opening in which the National Assembly\r\nand press remained relatively free from executive domination. At first,\r\nWashington seemed to accept this new order of things. In June 1920, the\r\nWilson administration recognized the new government, and in September\r\nit welcomed the victory of Provisional President Carlos Herrera in the\r\nfirst free election in Guatemalan history. But the Unionists’ rhetoric\r\nand policies soon rankled US. officials. Not only did nationalists in the\r\nassembly denounce Washington’s longstanding support of Estrada Cabrera,\r\nbut they also called for closer relations with Mexico and moved forward\r\nwith plans to form a Central American federation. In October 1921, just\r\nweeks after hosting a celebration of the centennial anniversary of Central\r\nAmerican independence, Herrera announced a union with El Salvador and\r\nHonduras-the two other nations that had ratified the Pact of San Jose.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThis democratic opening also allowed for the first public debates\r\nover United Fruit’s role in the country. Having initiated its operations in\r\nGuatemala during Estrada Cabrera’s rule, the firm had benefited tremendously from its ties to his regime. With the dictator gone, nationalists now\r\ncalled for a reining in of both United Fruit and Keith’s rail monopoly, the\r\nIRCA. Pressure came especially from planters and commercial interests\r\nwho demanded the IRCA end its distorted rate system, which continued\r\nto channel most of the nation’s commerce through Puerto Barrios. In the\r\nwaning days of the Wilson administration, some US. officials sympathized\r\nwith these grievances. Noting that the IRCA’s monopoly would never\r\nbe tolerated in the United States, one American diplomat declared, “<i>the\r\none reason which prevents the government from taking steps to better\r\nthe situation is the fear of the influence of the United Fruit Company in\r\nWashington.</i>"\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="...Then Another"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">&emsp;\r\nDespite his reluctance to confront United Fruit, Herrera could not ignore the rising currents of nationalism and labor militancy. One of his\r\nprincipal challenges was the Railroad Workers’ League, a union that was\r\ngrowing in strength despite the IRCA’s refusal to recognize it. By early\r\n1921, the league had purged its few remaining African American and West\r\nIndian members and allied itself with its counterpart in Mexico, a connection made easier by the fact that many of its members were Mexican. Soon\r\nafter, the union began calling on the Guatemalan government to curb the\r\nIRCA’s power and force the company to place Guatemalans in manage-\r\nrial positions." With the rail workers making effective use of nationalist\r\nrhetoric, Herrera felt increasingly compelled to confront the IRCA. In\r\nMay 1921, following a brief strike by the Railroad Workers’ League, he\r\ncanceled a 1908 concession that would have allowed the IRCA to extend a\r\nrail line to El Salvador. In response, Keith turned to Washington, where the\r\npro-corporate Harding administration took up his cause. Although some\r\nAmerican diplomats protested that Herrera remained friendly to US. business and adhered to “democratic principles,”Washington was adamant that\r\nhe restore the contract.The Guatemalan president refused to back down,\r\nhowever, and as Estrada Cabrera had done in 1914, he followed up his challenge to the IRCA by squeezing United Fruit’s labor supply. In October\r\n1921, with anti-American resentment building throughout the country,\r\nHerrera quadrupled the deposit required of black immigrants from $50 to\r\n$200 and made it retroactive to 1914. Fearing, quite rightly, that the new\r\nmeasure would chase West Indians from the country and thereby undercut\r\nits labor system, United Fruit once again requested support from the US.\r\ngovernment. In this case, however, American diplomats proved reluctant to\r\npressure Guatemala City, for the U.S. Congress itself had passed immigration restrictions the previous month. Nevertheless, the weakened Herrera\r\nfell to a military coup in December 1921.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nBoth the U.S. government and United Fruit initially welcomed the new\r\ngovernment headed by General José Maria Orellana. Despite noting with\r\nconcern that the new president was “certainly more than half Indian,” a\r\nspecial U.S. envoy declared him “stronger, more pro-American, and more\r\nhonest” than his predecessor." Over the following year, Washington helped\r\nOrellana shore up his regime, including offering assistance in the formation\r\nof a new Guatemalan constabulary. Part of a larger U.S. strategy beginning\r\nto take hold in the Hispanic Caribbean, this training of local security forces\r\naimed to secure order and project U.S. influence without the economic\r\nand political costs of overt intervention. As in other nations in the region,\r\nthe form this policy took hinged to a great extent on American perceptions\r\nof the local population, which were in turn rooted in U.S. imperial culture.\r\nSecurity forces “would require a different type of trained man in some of\r\nthe Republics from that which would be acceptable in some of the others,”\r\nexplained Major Fred T. Cruse, the U.S. military attache:\r\n<br>\r\n<span class="blockquote">\r\nI consider that officers of our Philippine Scouts or Philippine Constablary would be most suitable to organize the force in Guatemala, because\r\nthese officers have had experience in the Philippines dealing with divers[e]\r\nnative tribes, and that is what they would have to deal with in Guatemala.“</span>\r\n<br>\r\nFor their part, United Fruit managers hoped Orellana, a close associate\r\nof former president Manuel Estrada Cabrera, would prove friendlier to\r\ntheir interests and labor needs. But they were quickly disappointed.\r\nAlthough the new president annulled the Unionist constitution and with-\r\ndrew from the federation with El Salvador and Honduras, he made no\r\nattempt to coerce the legislature or curb what one US. official described\r\nas Guatemala’s “excessive” freedom of the press.SI And while Orellana\r\nhoped to repair relations with United Fruit, he understood that his political survival hinged to a great extent on his willingness to address nationalist concerns. Despite fierce pressure from Washington and United Fruit, he\r\nrefused to restore the IRCA’S contract, and he maintained strict enforce-\r\nment of the deposit requirement on black immigrants. Such policies set the\r\nstage for another bitter strike in Puerto Barrios.	large	t

But instability in the border region was a concern for\r\nboth the United States and Mexico, often leading to tensions between the two countries\r\nfollowing transboundary attacks by hostile parties. Article 11 of the Treaty of Guadalupe\r\nHidalgo required the United States to prevent incursions into Mexico by native peoples\r\nbecause the United States was gaining territory inhabited by “savage tribes.” Yet, for a\r\nnumber of years, the United States did not patrol its southern boundary. Its negligence not\r\nonly facilitated many transboundary Indian attacks against Mexico, but also those by U.S.\r\nfilibusters intent on wresting control of territory from Mexico. Over the decades\r\nfollowing the end of the war, a number of Texas-based filibusters attempted to “liberate”\r\nnortheast Mexico. Simultaneously, French and American filibusters used California as a\r\nbase from which to launch invasions of Sonora and Baja California. Mexico repeatedly\r\naccused the United States of not enforcing its own neutrality law requiring the federal\r\ngovernment to prosecute anyone in the United States planning, organizing, or engaging in\r\nmilitary expeditions against a country with which the United States was at peace.\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, however, the United States and Mexico had to resolve a boundary dispute\r\nunintentionally created by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which relied on inaccurate\r\nmaps to define the boundary of the territory of New Mexico and the Mexican states of\r\nSonora and Chihuahua. U.S. expansionists wanted to see the boundary line as far south as\r\npossible to gain a more favorable route for a transcontinental railroad and to ensure U.S.\r\naccess to the rich mines in the area of Mesilla (in present-day southern New Mexico).\r\nTensions flared as repatriated Mexicans and Anglo-Texan and New Mexican cattle\r\nranchers moved into Mesilla, the governors of Chihuahua and New Mexico both claiming\r\njurisdiction over the area and threatening to send troops to enforce their claims of\r\nsovereignty.\r\n<br><img src="/mapimages/jamesgadsden.jpg" style="float:right;padding:0px 7px;">\r\nThe United States sent James Gadsden, <i>pictured</i>, to Mexico City in 1853 to try to resolve the\r\nconflict with instructions to seek the abrogation of Article 11 of the Treaty of Guadalupe\r\nHidalgo. The United States also charged Gadsden with normalizing trade relations\r\nbetween the two countries, and with gaining U.S. transit rights through the Isthmus of\r\nTehuántepec to facilitate the construction of a railroad linking the Atlantic and Pacific\r\nOceans, a project whose importance had increased significantly with the discovery of\r\ngold in California in 1848. U.S. threats to seize parts of northern Mexico militarily\r\nconvinced the Mexican authorities of the wisdom of agreeing to American demands. The\r\nUnited States gained all that it sought, including the mineral rich areas in southern New\r\nMexican territory. In return, the federal government promised to pay Mexico $10 million\r\nin compensation for the acquired territory and pledged mutual cooperation in suppressing\r\nfilibustering activity, but the U.S. Senate removed the article relating to the latter from\r\nthe treaty. Once again, the United States had won a considerable victory over Mexico.</p>	large	f

The conflict began with the falling out of Diaz and his war minister, General Luis Mena, who then took command of the revolutionary army. As a result, on August 1, 1912, the New York Times reported that the United States had ordered the 500-ton gunboat Annapolis to proceed from San Juan del Sur to Corinto (both located along the Nicaraguan west coast) to protect Americans and American interests.\r\n<br>\r\nThe intervention got underway on August 4, at the request of the Diaz government, with the landing of 100 blue-jackets and Marines from the Annapolis. An estimated 3,500 Nicaraguan Government regulars at Managua were opposing a rebel force set at 2,300. Other revolutionists were operating in several communities along the Nicaraguan west coast. As August wore on and United States presence expanded, the insurgents bombarded Managua.\r\n<br>\r\nOn August 28, because of massacres and an impending attack on Managua, President William Howard Taft directed the dispatch of the Army's Tenth Infantry from Panama to Nicaragua.

One containing extra clothing, shoes, etc., and the other mess gear....\r\n<br>\r\n"This is only about 40 miles from Corinto inland but it took eleven hours to get here....The whole railroad system, which consists of about 90 miles of track and possibly a dozen engines with its other rolling stock, is owned entirely by American capital.\r\n<br>\r\nThe road runs into the interior as far as Managua.... The Liberals, who are known to us as the rebels, are in possession of nearly every town and city except Managua. This is still held by the Federals, but as we are given to understand, the Liberals will soon occupy that too.\r\n<br>\r\n"We have about 2,000 men in the country so far. Sailors from the (cruisers) California and Colorado make up about 800, and there are 1,200 Marines. We don't take part in their troubles here as long as they don't attempt to molest Americans or American interests. The people do not look upon our presence in their country with much favor, but they cannot help themselves for we have an armed force large enough to put them out of business should they start anything.\r\n<br>\r\n"They have a large army, but all their rifles are old-fashioned, whereas we are equipped with everything modem. There is no danger (of their) bothering us for they understand fully if one shot is fired at us by them, it means war and in that case they would probably lose their country altogether.\r\n<br>\r\n"Whenever we discover that they have anything that belongs to the railroad or to an American individual we just send a company of men, armed of course, and demand the property, which is soon given up by them....Guards are stationed at all bridges and other important points to prevent the renewal of destruction by the rebels.\r\n<br>\r\n"All trains also carry heavy guards to prevent their seizure. At all important towns along the line several companies of either Marines or sailors are stationed as a protection for Americans or other foreigners.\r\n<br>\r\n"At this place, Leon, we have a full battalion, for it is the largest city in the country. About forty thousand, I understand. This city is a rebel stronghold, but there are also a lot of the other side and consequently nearly everyone goes armed. One doesn't trust the other. Arms of all makes and descriptions can be seen, but the majority carry long saber-like knives or dirks. Even the women go armed.\r\n<br>\r\n"A week or so before our arrival they had a battle right in the city, in which two Americans were killed and several dozens of natives. The town is pretty quiet now though, except when they get news of a victory over the Federals from other sections. Then they celebrate by ringing all church bells, cheering, firing crackers, and (making) noise otherwise.\r\n<br>\r\n"We are located a half mile outside of the town, from where all details and guards (are) sent wherever required. It is awfully hot here during the day.... The language spoken is Spanish throughout and we have little trouble getting along with them as we have several interpreters in each company.\r\n<br>\r\n"The dress of the womenfolk is quite picturesque, although of cheap material. Their garments are mostly bright colored goods.... For headdress they use a scarf, which is removed when out of the sun and put about the shoulders....\r\n<br>\r\nEarly mornings they can be seen coming from all directions, heading toward the city with baskets of produce or prepared edibles for the market.... It seemed awful strange to me at first to see a crowd of these women come along with baskets upon their heads, hands down the side, for they need not steady them, marching along just as straight as can be...</i>"\r\n<br>\r\nThe peaceful tone of this letter reflected the premature general belief at the time that the situation was well in hand. But a few days later the revolution and the United States forces' role both began to heat up.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Heating Up"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\n\r\n \r\nClyde H. Metcalf's "A History of the United States Marine Corps," published by G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York, in 1939, records that two Marine artillery batteries, along with Butler's battalion, took a position near Coyotepe Hill (300 feet high) the night of October 2-3 under the overall command of Marine Col Joseph H. Pendleton. The rebel commander, Gen Zeledon, a former war secretary of Zelaya's cabinet, refused to surrender when given a final opportunity to do so.\r\n<br>\r\n"<i>We were in little danger from them however as their guns did not carry as far as ours. We were in position about 2,000 yards from the summit of the hills, and our shots did not all count as (we) had to locate just where their trenches and redoubts were.\r\n<br>\r\nEvery once in a while a shot would count though as we could see them come out from behind embankments and get on the opposite side of the hills. This was the object, to dislodge their guns and drive them off so that the infantry companies which were near at hand could advance and take the place with as little loss of life as possible.\r\n<br>\r\n"We could not dislodge them altogether from where we were, so we moved closer towards evening. It was dark by that time so we stopped firing that day, with the hills still in the possession of the rebels.\r\n<br>\r\n"About midnight we opened up on them again, but only about five shots as they made things interesting for us every time we fired. The flash of our guns gave them our location and a hail of bullets greeted us every time as they possibly had outposts not very far away from us. We decided to stop firing before they would (hit) one of our gun crews.\r\n<br>\r\n"At daybreak we started in on them again and the infantry companies (Marines and sailors) advanced upon their position, firing as they went. We had the hills and Old Glory flying on top within an hour of the time the fighting started.\r\n<br>\r\n"Our loss was four men killed and about ten wounded. The rebels left 32 dead and a small number wounded, besides a lot of prisoners were taken. They were turned over to the Federals, who made them prisoners of war. Most of the rebels escaped to the town of Masaya.\r\n<br>\r\n"There were possibly three or four hundred entrenched on the hills. As soon as the hills were taken by us, about 1,000 Federals were on hand to pass into the town of Masaya, where they fought for several hours in the streets, killing many on both sides. The rebels were finally routed with heavy loss and the Federals took possession of the town the rebels had held against them so long because they could not dislodge them from the approach to the place-the hills we had to gain for them.</i>"\r\n<br>\r\nIn his 1939 history, Metcalf wrote that as the attack reached its swift climax early in the morning of October 4 (Friday) Pendleton's forces comprised the First Battalion under Maj William N. McKelvy, the Third Battalion under Butler, with two Marine companies and a company of sailors from the Annapolis, plus a battalion of sailors from the California, placed east of Coyotepe Hill. He added that no Nicaraguan troops joined the assault although some had agreed to.\r\n<br>\r\nPendleton sent an 8 a.m. message from Coyotepe to Southerland at Managua, reporting: "The American flag now flies over Coyotepe and Barranca. We took Coyotepe and then also drove rebels from Barranca in thirty-seven minutes... only American forces stormed Coyotepe."\r\n<br>\r\nSoutherland himself issued four news dispatches from Managua on October 4, saying that the hills had been taken by Marines and bluejackets "after a most gallant assault," Masaya was taken by the government forces, the railroad between Managua and Granada was now safe, "and the starving inhabitants of Masaya will be relieved."\r\n<br>\r\nThe United States Legation in Nicaragua supplied an additional fact for the State Department, informing it that Zeledon had fled with his followers and was captured, dying shortly afterward.\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Leon"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\nZissa's official military record summarized his own part in the matter with the note: "Participated in bombardment, assault and capture of the fortifications of Coyotepe and Barranca at Managua, Nicaragua, October 3-4, 1912."\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the deep involvement of the United States produced criticism in the U.S., the performance of the Marines and sailors evoked praise. The Times, one of the critics, conceded for instance on October 7: "The bravery of our Marines who faced the Nicaraguan machine guns at (Coyotepe) and captured that rebel stronghold and Barranca, is not likely to be disputed..."\r\n<br>\r\nThat this climax to the conflict was not the end of the story was indicated by Southerland's announcement that LtCol C.G. Long "will now be given a force of 1,200 men at Leon, consisting of the First and second Battalions of Marines and the entire bluejacket companies of the California and the Colorado."\r\n<br>\r\nWhat then occurred at Leon was detailed by Zissa in the remainder of his October 9 letter to his future wife Flora Huetter, telling her that he and his fellow Marines "<i>found things pretty bad for ourselves upon returning here to Leon.\r\n<br>\r\n"This place,</i>" he went on, "<i>is about 75 miles from Granada and of course the news (of) how we had treated their fellow revolutionists at the other place had reached them. This made them rather aggressive towards us and before they had a chance to think it over our commander ordered them to surrender and turn in all their firearms and such other war material that might be in their possession.\r\n<br>\r\n"In the meantime we had assembled a force of over 1,000 Marines and sailors near the city to back up our demands.\r\n<br>\r\n"Leon is the largest city of the country, having a population of about 60,000 (other accounts concur with his first figure of 40,000) and it was a thorough rebel town-about 4,000 soldiers being in and about the place to protect it from invasion by government troops. The demands of our commander to the rebel chiefs were complied with as far as these chiefs could.\r\n<br>\r\n"On the morning of October 6 (Sunday), all the chiefs rode into our camp and surrendered the town to our commander, but they also informed him that they could not control all their soldiers as many had refused to give up their arms and had decided to fight us to the bitter end (should) we attempt to disarm them and take over their city.\r\n<br>\r\n"Well, anyway, two o'clock in the afternoon of the same day was the hour set when we would march in and take the city, no matter what the consequences might be in the attempt. Our officers knew by now what would happen and prepared accordingly. Our forces were distributed at different points on the outskirts of the town, and at the given hour all proceeded to march in to take possession.\r\n<br>\r\n"The rebels opened fire immediately upon our men from windows, housetops, church steeples, towers, and other places of concealment. Our men of course replied and went right on distributing men along the streets, disarming every rebel they could find. This was dangerous business and we had three men killed and about 12 wounded.</i> (Metcalf listed one Marine and two sailors killed, two Marines and one sailor wounded, and nearly 50 rebels killed.)\r\n<br>\r\n"<i>We had to go through houses and backyards looking for firearms and, frequently, shots were fired from some unseen place. If such place was discovered, a volley of our rifles would turn towards it and blaze away. Our men shelled several church towers where the rebels had machine guns in position and (had) done some damage to us. These places were all taken over by our men as the rebels were driven from them for they could not withstand the firing from our rifles very long.</i>"\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Refusal"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\n\r\n"<i>The fighting continued all afternoon and by dark very few of the defiant rebels were left in the town as they took to the hills outside of the city before the bullets of our guns. Many of them of course had to stay and be buried. Our doctors took charge of all wounded on both sides. Just how many natives were killed has not been given out by the authorities but there were quite a few-anyway a whole lot more than on our side.\r\n<br>\r\n"Many families of the town had left days before the trouble started and those that had stayed kept to their house with doors and everything barred while the fighting went on in the streets.\r\n<br>\r\n"By dark everything was quiet all over the city except the little noise our men made patrolling the streets. Believe me, every Marine and sailor in the town was wide awake that night and prepared to shoot any native who might attempt to make a crooked move. This of course was necessary for the protection of our lives.\r\n<br>\r\n"More trouble was expected the next morning but the lesson of the previous day seemed to have put fear of an American bullet into every native in the town. No more shots were fired on either side and quiet (reigned) all over the city, with our officers and men in full control.\r\n<br>\r\n"Until this day all natives of the place had been wearing red ribbons either on their hats, or red streamers in the lapel of the coat. This was the color of the revolutionists. The womenfolk in sympathy with the revolutionary movement wore red ribbons in their hair or about the waist. The town gave one the impression of a holiday celebration, with everyone wearing bright red colors of some shape or form.\r\n<br>\r\n"There was a big change though on the morning of the seventh, the day after we took possession. Every native appearing on the streets was in sober dress, devoid of any red color of any description as the wearing of red meant an enemy to us and they were liable to arrest or be shot if resistance was offered.\r\n<br>\r\n"This is Thursday, and ever since Sunday the most of our men have been patrolling the streets and searching houses for rifles and ammunition. The city is under martial law and it is the intention of our commander to disarm all natives, take everything in the line of firearms from them to discourage their revolutionary ideas and lead a more peaceful (existence) among themselves.\r\n<br>\r\n''The people of the town are becoming more friendly every day to our men patrolling the streets....Most of the time the last few weeks we were obliged to sleep wherever we might happen to be.... Yesterday was the first time in six days I had a chance to remove my shoes and get a little rest...</i>"\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\nSoutherland reported that Long's forces assumed complete control of the city and that the railroad was now safe from Corinto to Granada. The commander expected that peace would be general throughout the republic in less than a week. Nicaragua's abrupt disappearance from newspaper headlines in the United States indicated that his prediction was fulfilled.\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time of his next letter on November 14, Zissa had learned that his company was among three Marine companies selected to remain in Nicaragua while the others were to leave for Panama and the United States. His company then went to Managua as legation guard.\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Camp Elliott, Panama, January 27,1913, Zissa told of his departure from Corinto on January 10. In retrospect, at the time of writing, he realized he "was beginning to like it at Managua" and "would rather be in Nicaragua fighting rebels than stay here any length of time."\r\n<br>\r\nBut Zissa got used to Panama also, and he was later to write that he "<i>was on hand to see the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific meet when the canal was finished.</i>" The first ship passed through the waterway on August 15,1914, marking the climax of the canal's own role in the Nicaraguan revolution.\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\r\n<p style="background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\nThe 1912 intervention by units of Marines and armed sailors  ended the civil conflict  and essentially destroyed the rebel forces, but provided no guarantee of  future stability. Determined to prevent civil conflicts, the United States left  a company-sized force in Managua, ostensibly to guard the American legation, but actually to serve as an indicator of Washington’s refusal to tolerate \r\nefforts at armed revolution.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Sources"></div>\r\n<p class="entry" style="position:relative;top:350px;">\r\nExcerpts from Nicaragua, 1912 By Robert F.

563	The Evart Doctrine	1920	1920	usa2	power	Geopolitics and the Post-colonial by David Slater	<p class="entry columns" style="color:white;">In 1920, President Coolidge announces Evart Doctrine to justify U.S. intervention in internal affairs of Latin America in order to protect U.S. foreign holdings. President Coolidge was of the view that the person and property of a citizen are part of the general domain of the nation, i.e. the US nation, even when abroad. This thesis formed the basis of the Evart Doctrine,which claimed legal immunity for US citizens and their business activities in Latin America, in violation of the national sovereignty of the affected countries. This overarching position of the US government provided another modality of justification for interventionism in Latin America, and was a continuing source of friction in US-Latin American relations.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr style="height:2px; color:#cc0000; width: 60%;visibility:visible;">\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="color:white;font-size:small;padding:10px;padding-top:128px;">\r\nThe US was now a financially powerful nation&#8212;so powerful  that it was able to buy the Caribbean Islands of St. Thomas and St. \r\nCroix from Denmark in 1917. Those were the days when for the  first time the US dollar was badly needed for effective world trade. \r\nPushed on by Presidents Taft and Wilson, the dollar became a  diplomat. The period of "dollar diplomacy" defined by President \r\nTaft as a "policy... characterized as substituting dollars for bullets"  was ushered in. It was the logical amplification to the Monroe Doctrine in the era of the expat of capital for the exclusion of competitors and the staking out of hegemonistic claims; earlier, in the \r\nera of export of goods, there was the "open door" demand for  "equal rights" in Asia and the Arab world. \r\n<br>\r\nFinancial investment in the form of loans and the establishment \r\nof branch plants replaced trade as the main vehicle for penetration \r\nand profit-making in Latin America and the Caribbean. US \r\nbanking interests succeeded in wresting dominance in the bond and \r\nloan markets. And US investments increased from 17 per cent of all \r\ninvestments in Latin America in 1914 (second only to Britain) to \r\n40 per cent in 1929. U.S. direct investments, the bulk of which were \r\nmade in mining, agriculture, railways and petroleum, increased \r\nfrom $ 1.6 billion in 1914 to $3.5 billion in 1929. In 1913, Cuba(second to Mexico) and the Caribbean accounted for 20 per cent of \r\ndirect investment capital in Latin America." \r\n<br>\r\nAnd in this era of dollar diplomacy, foreign investment was \r\ngiven protection under the Evart doctrine, which stated that "the \r\nperson and property of a citizen are part of the general domain of \r\nthe nation, even when abroad". President Coolidge had pointed \r\nout that "there was a distinct and binding obligation on the part of \r\nself-respecting governments to afford protection to the persons and \r\nproperty of their citizens, wherever they may be."\r\n<br>\r\nSerious opposition-developed against the interventionist policies \r\nand practices of the "Colossus of the North" even to Woodrow \r\nWilson's indirect method of withholding recognition of revolutionary governments. A meeting of the Inter-American commission of \r\nJurists in Rio de Janeiro in 1927 resolved that "no state can interfere in the internal affairs of another". However, that principle \r\nwas not accepted by the Sixth International Conference of \r\nAmerican States in Havana in 1928. Under strong US proding in \r\nan atmosphere tailor-made for imperialistic arm-twisting, it was \r\ndecided to review the question of intervention at the next (seventh) \r\nconference: the Peruvian delegate, supported by others, had \r\nproposed a resolution which called on all countries to recognise the independence of each state, and that no control or intervention by  another should be tolerated.<br>\r\n<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 10px; font-family: helvetica, sans-serif; text-transform: uppercase;">The Caribbean: Whose backyard? by Cheddi Jagan</span>\r\n</p>	large	f

566	The Temporary Quota Act of 1921	1921	1921	usa3	power	Operation Gatekeeper by Joseph Nevins	<p class="entry columns3" style="margin-top:-5px;">The outbreak of World War I led the U.S. government to implement travel restrictions and to deploy troops along the boundary. This led to a decrease in\r\nunauthorized immigration and in illegal activity in the border region during the\r\nWar years of 1917–1918, despite the passage of additional restrictionist\r\nimmigration legislation in 1917 that, under normal circumstances, would have led to an\r\nincrease in unauthorized immigration as immigrants who would have previously gained\r\nlegal access to the United States would have had to have resorted to clandestine methods\r\nto enter. Yet the increased demands on boundary enforcement officials brought about by\r\nthe war (including the inspection of all peoples crossing from the United States into\r\nMexico) overwhelmed the authorities. It was during this time that discussions to establish\r\na permanent patrol force along the U.S.-Mexico boundary began. Thus, the roots of the\r\nU.S. Border Patrol are to be found not only in concerns about unauthorized immigration,\r\nbut also (and perhaps more so) in a preoccupation with matters of national security as\r\nrelated to the boundary.\r\n<br>\r\nUnauthorized entries picked up quickly following the end of the war and intensified as\r\nCongress placed additional restrictions on immigration. As a result, pressures for the\r\nBureau of Immigration to increase its efforts to fight illegal boundary activity grew. The\r\nbureau’s commissioner-general stressed in 1919 that such efforts were needed in the face\r\nof large numbers of apprehensions (seeming to suggest that many more were entering\r\nsuccessfully) of unauthorized European and Chinese immigrants smuggled in from\r\nCanada, Mexico, and Cuba. In the case of Cuba, reports in 1922 stated that there were\r\nmore than 30,000 unemployed Chinese immigrants on the island who soon intended to\r\nattempt to enter the United States. In the aftermath of the destruction of World War I,\r\nthere was also widespread fear that huge numbers of immigrants from Europe might try\r\nto enter the United States extralegally. Indeed, the number of entries into the United\r\nStates in 1920 was 300 percent that of the previous year. Such factors led to the passage\r\nof the temporary Quota Act of 1921, limiting the number of admissions of any one\r\nparticular nationality to three percent of the group’s population already in the United\r\nStates as reflected by the 1910 census. This marked the first quantitative immigration\r\nrestriction in U.S. history. The Immigration Act of 1924 made these quotas permanent,\r\nbut used the census of 1890 as its base. The act also required immigrants for the first time\r\nto obtain visas from U.S. consular officials abroad before traveling to the United States.\r\nThese restrictions had unintended consequences, leading to a rapid rise in the number of\r\nunauthorized European immigrants who would enter from Canada or Mexico, countries\r\nnot subject to quantitative immigration restrictions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\nAn economic recession in the aftermath of World War I facilitated hysterical nativist\r\nattacks against immigrants, especially Mexicans. As Wayne Cornelius notes, “Urged on\r\nby labor leaders and politicians, mobs of native-born Americans in Texas, Oklahoma, and\r\nother states launched attacks on Mexicans in their work places; vigilante groups\r\nterrorized them in their homes and destroyed their property.” Between 1920 and 1921,\r\nalmost 100,000 Mexicans left the United States “under varying degrees of coercion.”\r\nMany were U.S.-born Mexican Americans.\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f

Though the PR was a shell of\r\nits former self, its activists deeply compromised\r\nwith the counterrevolution, the party of Arevalo\r\nand Arbenz still held shreds of legitimacy\r\namong the electorate, 43.7% of whom abstained\r\nanyway."\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nDespite the obstacles strewn in his path by the\r\narmed forces, PR candidate Mendez Montenegro\r\nran out winner, presenting himself demagogically\r\nas head of the "Third Government of\r\nthe Revolution." By this time, the Army was in\r\ndeep trouble against the guerrillas. Though\r\nMendez looked a model Alliance for Progress-style\r\ncandidate, the Pentagon opposed his election.\r\nThe dilemma between military imperatives\r\nand reformist rhetoric was swiftly resolved:\r\nMendez would take office, but not real power&#8212;\r\nthat would go to the military. With a\r\nU.S.-mediated military-civilian pact in its\r\npocket, Washington insisted that the armed\r\nforces respect the election results.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nMendez invited U.S. military advisers into\r\nGuatemala the day after his inauguration, entrusting\r\nto them a counterinsurgency campaign\r\ncrafted with the heady confidence of a pre-Tet\r\noffensive Vietnam. In the eastern mountains,\r\noperations under Col. Carlos Arana Osorio,\r\nknown as the "Butcher of Zacapa," virtually\r\nwiped out the guerrillas and claimed 8,000\r\npeasant lives in two years. In that savagely\r\npolarized region, the MLN was the only established\r\nright-wing force. Many peasants were\r\nnervous about the guerrilla advance, and the\r\nMLN's aggressive recruitment campaign, in\r\nwhich no neutrals were allowed, brought the\r\nparty broad support and potential for a genuinely\r\nmass-based fascist movement.\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/guatamalaexhumation.jpg">\r\n<span class="caption">In 2004, a crowd watches the exhumation of a mass grave in Comalapa.

Hardly. A\r\nmajor debate hinged on the overhaul of Guatemala's\r\ntax system, one of the most regressive in\r\nthe world. (Central government revenues averaged\r\na mere 9% of the gross domestic product.)\r\nBowing to private sector pressure, which denounced\r\nthe fiscal proposals as "communist,"\r\nMendez sacked his progressive finance minister,\r\nAlberto Fuentes Mohr.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAgain, U.S. influence at a crucial juncture\r\nwas decisive.

The legislation includes the Oriental Exclusion Act, which bans all Asian immigration except that from the Philippines. The 1924 act also requires immigrants for the first time to obtain visas from U.S. consular officials abroad before traveling to the United States. As before, the restrictions have unintended consequences, leading to a rapid rise in the number of unauthorized European immigrants who would enter from Canada or Mexico, countries not subject to immigration quotas. The Department of Labor Appropriations Act grants one million dollars for &ldquo;additional land-border patrol,&rdquo; thus creating the U.S. Border Patrol.	medium	t

In the aftermath of a\r\nmassive deportation and repatriation campaign of people of Mexican origin from the\r\nUnited States in the 1930s, the Border Patrol grew considerably. The outbreak of World\r\nWar II caused great consternation within the administration of Franklin Delano\r\nRoosevelt, which feared that foreign agents with anti-American intentions would attempt\r\nto enter the United States clandestinely. The administration played an important role in\r\nconstructing immigration and border enforcement as issues of national security. As a\r\nresult, the administration transferred the Immigration and Naturalization Service from the\r\nDepartment of Labor to the Department of Justice. (President Hoover had consolidated\r\nthe Bureau of Immigration and the Bureau of Naturalization into the INS in 1933.) Two\r\nweeks later, Congress appropriated two million dollars to add 712 Border Patrol officers\r\n(almost doubling the size of the force), 57 auxiliary personnel, and the needed\r\nequipment. The Border Patrol carried out many functions during the war, including\r\nguarding “enemy alien” detention camps and diplomats as well as helping the U.S.\r\nmilitary guard the country’s east coast against the potential entry of agents from the Axis\r\npowers.</p>	large	f

Bulmer-Thoma	<p class="columns bigquote">\r\nThe espousal of the Atlantic Charter and Roosevelt's four freedoms by Central America's caudillos appeared at odds with the policies of domestic political repression. It is doubtful if this argument on its own could have accounted for the events which unfolded in Central America in 1944, but combined with weak political representation of the professional class and an economic decline during the years of World War 2, it added up to a powerful case for political change.\r\n<br>\r\nDiscontent began to surface in 1943 with unsuccessful military revolts in Honduras and El Salvador. In April 1944, another military coup was attempted in El Salvador and failed, but the repression which followed unleashed a strike by students which was taken up by the whole of San Salvador. Nervous about popular unrest in El Salvador, the United States advises General Martinez to resign. By mid-May, Martinez had resigned, following the advice of the US ambassador, and his resignation sent a tremor through the neighboring republics, though Military rule continues in El Salvador. In the next four months, there were student strikes and urban protests throughout Central America. In Honduras and Nicaragua, the protests were crushed, but the movements did produce new political parties; in Guatemala, however, a general strike achieved the resignation of Ubico, following a protest by students and teachers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	large	f

Its formal title in English is the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance and, in Spanish, Tratado Interamericano de Asistencia Rec&iacute;proca. Since then, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Trinidad and Tobago and the Bahamas have adhered to the Treaty, but Cuba withdrew on March 29, 1960, and Mexico gave notice in 2002 of its intention to do so also. By Article 3 of the Treaty the signatories "agree that an armed attack by any states against an American state shall be considered as an attack against all the American states", and consequently "undertake to assist in meeting the attack in exercise of the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the UN Charter." The procedure for doing so is that "on the request of the state or states directly attacked and until the decision of the organ of consultation of the inter-American system," each of the signatories "may determine immediate measure which it may individually adopt in fulfillment of the obligation contained in the preceding paragraph and in accordance with the principle of continental solidarity. The organ of consultation shall meet without delay for the purpose of examining these measures and agreeing upon measures of a collective character that should be adopted." The Treaty was invoked on 14 occasions between 1948 and 1962; it has only been invoked once since, by the USA in 2001.</p>	large	f

595	The rise of Jorge Gaitan	1947	1947	col1	redstar		Since the late 1840s the Conservative and Liberal parties have dominated Colombian politics. The Conservative Party has historically aligned with and represented the interests of the large landholding oligarchy and the Catholic Church. The Liberal Party, on the other hand, has been more closely aligned with Colombia&rsquo;s commercial sector and tended to view the Catholic Church as a backward social institution that prevented economic modernization. Although for many years their policy programmes were largely indistinguishable, the rise of Jorge Gaitan, a left-wing Liberal Party member during the 1940s, managed to reorient the Liberal Party towards a more reformist and egalitarian agenda that sought modest land reforms and progressive labour laws. Gaitan&rsquo;s populism was based on his appeal to the poor and dispossessed throughout Colombia; in the words of Jenny Pearce, he sought to make &lsquo;capitalism socially responsible, not to abolish it&rsquo;.38 Gaitan took over the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1947, and was almost certain to win elections scheduled for 1950.	medium	t
596	The Killing of Gaitan, the Bogotazo, and La Violencia	1948	1949	col2	massacre		Jorge Gaitan’s increasingly populist appeal, combined with his overt rhetoric attacking the unequal distribution of national resources, made Colombia’s ruling class, and especially the large landowners aligned with the Conservative Party, increasingly worried and hostile. Gaitan was subsequently assassinated in Bogotá (Colombia’s capital city) in 1948. His assassination ended the democratic challenge to oligarchic rule in Colombia, and destroyed the hopes of the poor majority that he represented. His death also ‘ruptured the breakwaters holding back years of discontent’ and the immediate response to his assassination was a spontaneous popular uprising in Bogotá that destroyed established symbols of power and privilege. The Colombian military put down the uprising but the violence spread to Colombia’s rural areas and sparked a large-scale civil war within Colombia now known as <i>la violencia</i>. <br> <i>Galeano Now</i>: When he was shot dead, the hurricane was unleashed. First the spontaneous bogotazo&#8212;an uncontrollable human tide in the streets of the capital; then the violence spread to the countryside, where bands organized by the Conservatives had for some time been sowing terror. The bitter taste of hatred, long in the peasants' mouths, provoked an explosion; the government sent police and soldiers to cut off testicles, slash pregnant women’s bellies, and&#8212;throw babies in the air to catch on bayonet points--the order of the day being "don't leave even the seed." Liberal Party sages shut themselves in their homes, never abandoning their good manners and the gentlemanly tone of their manifestos, or went into exile abroad. It was a war of incredible cruelty and it became worse as it went on, feeding the lust for vengeance. New ways of killing came into vogue: the <i>corte corbata</i>, for example, left the tongue hanging from the neck. Rape, arson, and plunder went on and on; people were quartered or burned alive, skinned or slowly cut in pieces; troops razed villages and plantations and rivers ran red with blood. Bandits spared lives in exchange for tribute, in money or loads of coffee, and the repressive forces expelled and pursued innumerable families, who fled to seek refuge in the mountains. Women gave birth in the woods. The first guerrilla leaders, determined to take revenge but without clear political vision, took to destroying for destruction's sake, letting off blood and steam without purpose.	medium	t

Originally based in Mexico, the ORIT was been created within the framework of Cold War politics with the aim of &quot;resisting communist influence&quot; in Latin America. When it was based in Cuba in the early 1950s, ORIT first opposed the 1953 military coup that brought dictator Fulgencio Batista to power, then accommodated itself to his brutal regime. When the Castro-led revolution prevailed in 1959, ORIT ﬂed to Mexico City to set up its new headquarters and chose one of Batista’s former cabinet members as an assistant to ORIT’s general secretary.’ It was common knowledge among Latin American unionists that ORIT fronted for the CIA. As one US State Department official put it,“ORIT was bought and paid for by Uncle Sam.” <br> Philip Agee, the former CIA agent and whistleblower, fingered ORIT as &quot;a principal mechanism for CIA labor operations in Latin America&quot; Its purpose, said Agee, was to subvert radical Latin American unions and help the CIA &quot;divide the victims and neutralize their leaders.&quot; One could hardly miss the CIA connections. Agee reported that, as of 1963, several ORIT bosses&#8212;its secretary-general and assistant secretary-general&#8212;were CIA agents.  <BR> The CIA apparently viewed ORIT as incompetent. Agee, in a 1960 diary entry, wrote: &quot;Officers in the WH Division [the CIA’s Western Hemisphere Division] were practically unanimous in condemning ORIT. . . .

598	Mutual Security Act	1951	1951	usa2	power		1951 U.S. Congress passes Mutual Security Act, which makes funds available to strengthen Latin American armies for hemispheric defense.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThe legal foundations for the new system of military and police collaboration among nation-states were set by the U.S. Congress over a period of just four years, starting in , when it gave President Truman the authority to help the governments of Greece and Turkey to defend themselves from communists. It was the first time that military collaboration became a paramount peacetime foreign policy tool. Two years later, Truman asked Congress to go a step further and authorize “military aid to free nations to enable them to protect themselves against the threat of aggression.” The result was the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of  October , the law upon which all subsequent military collaboration programs, including government grants of equipment and training services as well as cash sales and credit sales, were founded.14 It authorized the conveyance, “without payment to the United States,” of “military assistance in the form of equipment, materials, and services” and it defined equipment and materials as “any arms, ammunition or implements of war, or any other type of material, article, raw material, facility, tool, machine, supply, or item that would further the purposes of this Act, or any component or part thereof, used or required for use in connection therewith, or required in or for the manufacture, production, processing, storage, transportation, repair, or rehabilitation of any equipment or materials, but shall not include merchant vessels.” Services included “any service, repair, training of personnel, or technical or other assistance or information necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Act.”15\r\nAlthough the act only authorized gifts of military assistance through the Military Assistance Program (MAP) to member states of NATO plus Iran, Korea, and the Philippines, it permitted the president to sell military equipment, materials, and services to any other country that may have joined the United States in a “collective defense and regional arrangement,” but only so long as such a country paid the full cost of the transfers in advance. The latter was called the “408-e” program.16 Within a year, however, as a result of both the widening conflict over Korea and the success of the communist revolution in China, Asia suddenly emerged as a military-collab-oration priority, radically expanding the potential geographical scope of collaboration and calling for new legislation to replace that of 1949. The result was the Mutual Security Act of 10 October 1951, in which Congress expanded the number of countries for which assistance was authorized. This act also authorized grant collaboration with Latin America for the first time, but in doing so Congress added a restriction that would become increasingly controversial before it was finally abandoned by about 1961. Grant collaboration could be authorized “only in accordance with defense plans which are found by the President to require the recipient country to participate in missions important to the defense of the Western Hemisphere,” and under the terms of bilateral agreements “designed to assure that the assistance will be used to promote the defense of the Western Hemisphere.”17 In other words, grant collaboration to protect Latin American government from internal enemies was prohibited. Grant collaboration could only be undertaken to defend Latin America\r\n\r\nagainst an attack from outside the hemisphere. If the fear of a Soviet attack on Latin America was a paranoid fantasy, it is well to recall that it was one that gripped the United States itself in the first years of the Cold War. In 1950, Congress created the Army Antiaircraft Command, which hastily installed gun defenses against a Soviet air attack across the United States over the next six years, when Nike missiles began replacing the guns. By 1963, 219 surface-to-air missile batteries were defending the United States against Soviet bombers.\r\n\r\n\r\n--!>	medium	t

He was himself immediately killed, receiving thirty-five bullet wounds. As we know, he did in fact &quot;initiate the beginning of the end&quot; of that tyranny. Rigoberto tried to console his mother by denying that his act was a sacrifice: &quot;I hope that you will take this calmly. You must understand that my act is a duty that any Nicaraguan would desire to be done for his country . . . not a sacrifice, but a duty that I want to fulfill.&quot; \r\n<br>In 1972, Carlos Fonseca Amador, founder and leader of the FSLN, published in Cuba an essay entitled &quot;Notes on the Testimonial Letter of Rigoberto Lopez Perez,&quot; which concluded: &quot;no epistle by an evangelist . . . no decalogue by a hero or treatise on virtue contains more ethical richness than the words of Rigoberto Lopez Perez to his mother, affirmed with his lifeblood&quot;. \r\n</span><br><span style="margin-left: 20px;">The themes of Rigoberto’s letter have become almost mythic in Nicaragua — the son or daughter who gives his or her life, but not as a sacrifice; the young revolutionary who wins the support of his or her mother, and often her cooperation, in revolutionary struggle; the dignity of duty, deﬁned as working for the liberation of one’s people; the ideal of the &quot;new person,&quot; drawn from Cuba’s revolution; the revolutionary motivated by feelings of great love (as Che expressed it), who overcomes egoism and fear and commits his or her life to creating a new society. For many in Nicaragua these themes have come alive in their revolution, giving it deep spiritual meaning. Christians see love of one’s neighbor put into practice. Jesus becomes a model for revolutionary Nicaraguans alongside Che Guevara. \r\n\r\n</span><br><span style="margin-left: 20px;">Somoza&rsquo;s killer, Rigoberto L&oacute;pez P&eacute;rez, was slain on the spot by presidential bodyguards. A twenty-seven-year-old poet, L&oacute;pez P&eacute;rez had loose ties to the dissident PLI, and he had been trained and armed by anti-Somoza former National Guardsmen who lived in exile in El Salvador. Sixteen years later, in his &lsquo;&lsquo;Notes on the \r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/rigobertolopezperez.png" class="floatleft">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTestimonial Letter of Rigoberto L&oacute;pez P&eacute;rez,&rsquo;&rsquo; Fonseca described L&oacute;pez P&eacute;rez as a &lsquo;&lsquo;legitimate child of Sandino,&rsquo;&rsquo; characterizing his action as &lsquo;&lsquo;not just understandable but also justifiable&rsquo;&rsquo; because &lsquo;&lsquo;in the whole country there was no organization, no leadership, no revolutionary consciousness." Fonseca had no praise for L&oacute;pez P&eacute;rez in 1956, however, when he was still committed to nonviolent methods and believed that the PSN provided the leadership Nicaragua needed. \r\n</span><br><span style="margin-left: 20px;">\r\nSomoza's eldest son, Luis Somoza Debayle, becomes president. President Luis Somoza declared a state of siege after his father&rsquo;s killing and began a roundup of suspected conspirators that was particularly intense in Le&oacute;n. The area surrounding the university was turned into an armed camp, its streets blocked by barbed wire and patrolled by the National Guard. Hundreds of students and other dissidents were arrested, including Carlos Fonseca, who had never met L&oacute;pez P&eacute;rez and knew nothing about the assassination plot. Held from September 27 to November 14, Carlos was eventually released without charges, probably as a result of his father&rsquo;s intervention.

It did for foreign police officers what the SOA did for the military. OPS provided training abroad for more than a million policemen in the Third World, ten thousand of whom were selected to come to Washington for advanced training. There may well have been more serious human-rights abusers amongst the OPS police students than amongst the SOA military graduates because of the former's closer and more frequent contact with the populace. Moreover, most of the classes were held abroad, where the instructors could feel less constrained than in Washington or Georgia about lecturing in a very militant manner on &quot;the communist menace&quot; and the use of any means necessary to combat it. <span style="background-color:black;color:white;"> Amongst the means sometimes taught was torture. </span>\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOPS provided the police with weapons, ammunition, radios, patrol cars, tear gas, gas masks, batons and other crowd control devices; a class on Assassination Weapons—&quot;A discussion of various weapons which may be used by the assassin&quot; is how OPS put it; and instruction on the design, manufacture and employment of bombs and incendiary devices, taught at the &quot;bomb school&quot; in Los Fresnos, Texas.<span style="background-color:black;color:white;"> The official OPS explanation for the bomb courses was that policemen needed such training in order to deal with bombs placed by terrorists. There was, however, no instruction in destroying bombs, only in making them. </span><br> When Congress abolished the Public Safety Program in 1975 in response to rising criticism of this dark side of American foreign policy, the Drug Enforcement Administration, with help from the FBI and the Defense Department, quietly stepped in and continued the program. In various reincarnations, the program continues, just as the School of the Americas made it to the 21st century.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Its Predecessor"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns">\r\n&emsp;By 1957, five different U.S. government agencies—State, Defense, the International Cooperation Administration (ICA—the predecessor of the Agency for International Development), the Central Intelligence Agency, and the U.S. Information Agency—were collaborating with foreign governments in the realm of “internal security.” To coordinate their efforts, the Eisenhower administration created the Overseas Internal Security Program (OISP). The Defense Department was supposed to provide training, arms, ammunition, and equipment to “police forces operating under foreign defense establishments,” as well as training and equipping both paramilitary and military forces “for counter-intelligence and anti-guerrilla operations.” The ICA targeted civil police agencies, supplying equipment, training, and advice under what was alternately called the Public Safety Program or the “1290(d) program” after the number assigned to one of the National Security Council’s 1954 decisions. In December 1956, the only Latin American country with an ICA-run program was Guatemala, one of ten in the world. The ICA supported the “operation of country-wide communications networks, maintenance of national personal registration and identification systems, fire fighting and fire prevention, prison administration, control of customs, control of immigration, control of activities of foreigners, coast guard functions, domestic counter-intelligence and control of subversive activities, border control,” and even regulatory activities.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;The CIA’s early participation in police collaboration programs was broadened in March 1955, when it agreed to contribute to the ICA programs “a small highly trained nucleus of counter subversive specialists who would be supported by the larger conventional components” of the police program. The CIA’s role in covert aspects of police training expanded rapidly, as suggested by the decision of the Operations Coordinating Board (OCB) in September 1956 to place the operation of the 1290-d program under the control of a “Senior Group” headed by a “Senior Official” with access “to the covert aspects of this program on a need-to-know basis consistent with the operational security considerations involved.” By March 1961, the CIA had thirty-three employees “integrated into ICA Public Safety programs in twelve countries and is conducting parallel activities in other countries in support of OISP objectives.” Robert Amory, Jr., whose tenure as deputy director of the CIA from 1957 to 1962 spanned the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, told an interviewer in 1966 that the CIA became the “brains” of police collaboration. From the start, the CIA was active in\r\n<span class="blockquote" style="font-style:italic;">\r\nhelping develop internal police forces, which is a dangerous ground because you can get to Gestapo type tactics and so on and so forth, but essentially bringing to bear good police methods—good filing systems, good fingerprinting systems, good systems of riot control such as using dye so when you get the ring leaders, they can’t wash the dye off their clothes, without having a riot squad that picks up a lot of innocent people who just happen to be caught on a street corner. They worked very closely with AID on this. It’s a program called 1290D which could be a very good subject of a, you know, Ph.D. monograph sometime—which involved who was responsible in this police thing, and it fell back and forth between AID and CIA. Finally, under [Robert] Bob Komer’s leadership on the White House Staff, a task force was set up under Alexis Johnson. I happened to sit on it, and we solved the problem in a rather rude, but practical fashion of saying, “By God, AID will be responsible for it, but the brains are in CIA, so we’ll move those brains over to AID.” So we just took the CIA men—I can’t think of his name now [Byron Engle]—and gave them the mission of training police forces using American police forces occasionally as sort of sponsors, using Michigan State University School of Police Work, which is the best in the country, and a lot of excellent work has been done there.</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n	large	f

Patrice McSherry	<p class="columns" style="float: left; width:730px;" >\r\n<img src="/mapimages/Yarborough-With-Kennedy-ps.jpg"  style="max-width:50%;" class="floatleft">\r\nAfter the Cuban revolution, President John F. Kennedy (1961–63) created the Special Forces (Green Berets) and demanded that the U.S. Army reorganize to fight political-military wars. Kennedy ordered an ambitious new two-pronged security policy for Latin America: the Alliance for Progress, to foster social development in the region, and counterinsurgency programs, to prevent and contain revolution. The structural changes required for socioeconomic reform in Latin America were resisted, however, by the very elites and military forces strengthened by the counterinsurgency strategy. After Kennedy’s assassination, under the Mann doctrine, the counterinsurgency half of the strategy came to dominate the U.S. approach to the region.\r\n<br>\r\nIn 1960, the U.S. commander-in-chief of SOUTHCOM, Major T.F.Bogart, initiated the Conference of American Armies, a hemispheric security organization dominated by the United States and its organizational and ideological doctrines. U.S. military officers played a prominent role in these conferences. SOUTHCOM hosted the first, at Fort Amador in the Panama Canal Zone, where commanders from seventeen armies discussed specific accords to guide and regulate future combined activities. The yearly conferences, secret sessions that excluded civilians, provided a means for the Latin American armies, under U.S. tutelage, to form coordinated strategies—with no civilian input or control—and solidify an anticommunist front in the Americas.\r\n<br>\r\nPartially through the vehicle of these conferences, the countersubversive security doctrine was developed and expanded, and the inter-American defense system reorganized to deal with the perceived subversive threat in the Americas.\r\n<br>\r\nThe second of the secret articles forming the charter of the Conference of American Armies stated that the mission of the armies was “to protect the continent from the aggressive action of the International Communist Movement,” a movement that instigated internal subversion. In the conferences planning, intelligence sharing, and strategizing overwhelmingly emphasized the subversive threat. According to a 1985 history of the conferences, early meetings in the 1960s focused on the creation of a continental doctrine to fight “communist aggression”; the interchange of intelligence about subversive groups and international communism; the establishment of a permanent inter-American intelligence committee, located in the Panama Canal Zone; the setting up of schools of intelligence in each country; the creation of a system of encoded telecommunications among the armies; and programs of training for all the armies in strategies of countersubversion, counterrevolution, and internal security. Operation Condor, which was organized later, was clearly an outgrowth of these transnational structures and programs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style="background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;width:250px; margin-left: 760px">\r\n“ … It’s very rare that an element of the [U.S.] armed forces gets singled out by a president like that, and so this is a special thing to honor and I was glad to be part of it … both my alma maters, if you will, the [Army] Special Forces and the CIA [Central Inteligence Agency], both grew out of the [World War II] OSS [Office of Strategic Services] tradition and share that heritage today. But it really wasn’t until the 1960s with President Kennedy that [we saw] one of the periods of great growth in Special Forces, and it really put us on a path that we remain on to this day. There really is a lot of continuity in it. Missions have changed a little bit, and tactics have changed, but the path that was set forward in the early 1960s really remains with us today.” &#8212;Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael G.

The problem lay in their inability\r\nto do so mostly due to their main allegiance to the elite class, whom they also\r\nfailed to fully satisfy. Instead of seeking to alleviate the poor conditions of the\r\nmajority of the country, they relied on the tried and true method of throwing\r\nthe proverbial bone down the socioeconomic ladder hoping to placate\r\nthe sentiments of those who had supported revolutionary radicalism in the\r\npast. The military sought out people who would maintain their authority\r\nacross the country. In the place of creating programs that responded to the\r\nproblems of the rural poor population, the military sought the support of\r\nsquads that protected the oligarchy through the use of violence and intimidation,\r\nthus resulting in groups such as the Democratic Nationalist Organization\r\n(ORDEN).\r\n</td><td>\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/framemedrano.jpg">\r\n</td><td width=300px>\r\nThe Christian Democratic Party (PDC) gained considerable ground throughout the 1960s.\r\nDuarte was elected mayor of the capital in 1964 and served three consecutive\r\nterms until 1970 when he began preparing for a presidential bid for the 1972\r\nelections. By 1968, the PDC had nearly 40 percent control over the legislative\r\nassembly and even began passing its own party’s laws. This represented an\r\never growing danger to the power of the PCN, who had won the presidency\r\nof 1967 with Colonel Fidel Sanchez Hernandez (1967–1972). Sanchez ordered\r\nthe National Guard to crack down on political and labor dissent. The Guard’s\r\nnew head was Colonel Jose Alberto Medrano, <i>pictured</i>, an officer who acquired funds\r\nto increase the activities of ORDEN, which was used both for public service\r\nand to spy on, intimidate, and liquidate the opposition, namely in the countryside.\r\nIt was during this period that U.S. military assistance expanded, with\r\nthe mindset that any dissent against the government must be illegitimate. The\r\nresult was support for repressive regime after repressive regime in El Salvador,\r\nlasting until 1992.\r\n</td></tr></table>	large	f

According to an American businessman who worked in the construction industry, Nicaragua &quot;was an easy place to do business in but you had to know the type of business conducive to low labor costs.

The Central American Common Market collapses.</p>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\n&emsp;\r\nImmediately after Honduras loses the third of a trio of impassioned playoff matches to El Salvador—the final qualifying games for a single remaining slot in the 1970 World Cup championship in Mexico—the already strained relations between both nations reach a boiling point when the dictatorial Honduran president López Arellano severs diplomatic relations with his neighbor. The football rivalry coincided with a political dispute over immigration between the two countries.  Essentially, El Salvador was a smaller country than Honduras and had a much larger population.  The border between the two nations was less-than-perfectly defined, and an estimated 300,000 Salvadorians immigrated onto the more spacious Honduran territory, causing some resentment from native Hondurans.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAfter losing the first football match, El Salvadorian nationalist fervor erupted.  The fans were so riled that when the Honduran team came to El Salvador to play the second match, the Salvadorian Security Service had to hide the Honduran team at an undisclosed location.  As Honduran fans traveled home after losing the match, some Salvadorians threw rocks at their cars.\r\n<img src="/mapimages/soccerwar1969.jpg" class="floatright" style="max-width:100%;padding:0px;">\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nDue in large part to exaggerated media reports, unorganized mobs in Honduras retaliated against the Salvadorian immigrants living on Honduran territory.   Salvadorian business were destroyed, refugees fled, people were killed.  The Salvadorian government accused Honduras of genocide.  After intermittent border clashes, 12,000 Salvadoran troops cross the border in two columns on the afternoon of July 14, occupying the towns of El Amatillo and Nacaoné, as well as the regional capital of Nueva Ocotepeque— five miles from the frontier—by the next evening. According to a CIA report, “a nationwide Honduran radio network…exhorted civilians in the western highway area to grab machetes or other weapons and move to the front to assist the army.”World War II–vintage, propeller-driven airplanes are also used to drop bombs on Toncontin Air Base outside Tegucigalpa, while Honduran islands in the Gulf of Fonseca are assaulted. This offensive quickly bogs down, though, when Honduran F4U-5 Corsair fighters counterattack and severely damage El Salvador’s main oil-storage facilities at the port of Cutuco and Acajutla. The Salvadoran drive from Nueva Ocotepeque on toward Santa Rosa de Capán is then checked by Honduran warplanes, while air transports ferry 1,000 soldiers of the presidential “Guardia de Honor” Battalion from Tegucigalpa to reinforce that threatened town.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe Organization of American States arranges a cease-fire by the evening of July 18, which goes\r\ninto effect two days later.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe Salvadorans subsequently demand reparations for the more than 60,000 Salvadoran citizens who have been chased out of Honduras, as well as guarantees for the safety of those left behind. The\r\nthreat of economic sanctions, however, compels them to withdraw their troops by August 5. This\r\nconflict has inflicted between 2,000 and 3,000 fatalities on both sides, in addition to leaving thousands\r\nmore homeless and disrupting both frail economies. Repression of El Salvadoran activists during the conflict will fuel a shift to the left over the next decade.\r\n\r\nA peace treaty will not be concluded until October 30, 1980.\r\n</p>	large	f

The National Palace, a tasteless old building with pretensions of grandeur, takes up a whole block. The edifice is flanked by numerous windows; the columned façade of this banana parthenon looks out upon the desolate Square of the Republic. Besides the Senate, on the ground floor, and the Chamber of Deputies, on the first, it houses the Exchequer, the Ministry of the Interior and the Directorate-General of Revenue. Of all the Government buildings in Managua, it is the most public and the most heavily staffed. There is always a policeman, armed with a shotgun, stationed at every entrance, two more on the staircases leading to the first floor and several of the Ministers’ and Deputies’ armed bodyguards wander about the place. During working hours, between the basement, hallways and offices, no fewer than 3,000 people, employees and members of the general public are in the building. However, the leadership of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (SNLF) did not consider the storming of this marketplace of bureaucracy insanely simple, but just the opposite: a crazy masterstroke."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe group is led Commander Zero - Eden Pastora - takes the National Palace in Managua, holding 1,500 hostages, including 49 deputies of the national assembly. The two-day occupation focuses world attention on Nicaragua and the Sandinistas. One of the other leaders of the attack, commander two, is a twenty-two year old lesbian, Dora María Téllez, who later leads the successful taking of the city of Leon.\r\n<br>&emsp;Years later, both will split with the Ortega leadership: Pastora will reject the political dimensions of the revolution and form a Contra army in the South, ARDE; Téllez will push back against the sexist and homophobic machismo of the National Directorate and eventually form a dissident party (Movimiento de Renovación Sandinista) challenging the rightward shift of the Ortega-led Sandinista National Liberation Front.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="The View from Dora Maria Tellez I"></div>\r\n\r\n<table style="border-spacing: 10px;position:relative;top:-20px;"><tr><td valign=top width=55%><p class="entry">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/nicaraguanphostages.jpg">\r\n<br>&emsp;<strong>"This operation was planned well in advance.</strong> It was long\r\nand very detailed. So when we reached the palace, the\r\nlayout had already been surveyed. We had identified\r\nwhich people worked in what offices. Information had\r\nbeen compiled, and all the details precisely recorded.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThere was someone whom we called "la Espina"\r\nor "the thorn." He is the father of one of our leaders,\r\nComandante Pichardo, who is now one of the major\r\nmilitary leaders in the battle against the mercenary\r\nforces. So this man worked in the palace. We had\r\nphotographs of the palace, taken with a very small\r\ncamera. We had taken pictures of many rooms and staircases\r\nfrom different angles and we had architectural\r\nplans. We had also studied the access roads to the\r\npalace, and the time required to travel them. So those\r\nof us who were not familiar with the palace-as most\r\nof us were not-looked at the pictures, studied the plans\r\nand listened to the descriptions which our people who\r\nhad been in the palace were able to give us. At that time,\r\na new congressional session was being inaugurated, and the inauguration was broadcast on television.\r\n</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign="top">\r\n<p class="entry">\r\nThis also\r\nhelped us to \r\nstudy some of the palace interiors.\r\nHowever, the palace is very big, and we had really only\r\nplanned to take over the second floor. In fact that's what\r\nwe did, because 25 people were too few to take over\r\nthe entire palace. What happened was that we had to\r\nclose all the doors, and we stayed inside with 2,000\r\npeople.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIf these 2,000 people had panicked, if they had been\r\nagainst the action, probably none of us would have survived.\r\nOf the thousands that were there, some belonged\r\nto the Frente and supported the takeover. So they\r\nbehaved calmly, without provoking any kind of crisis\r\nor problems. They were very cooperative. This made\r\nthe success of the action possible.\r\nI am talking about the workers there. And I am talking\r\nabout the people who were in the palace that day.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nTaxes were paid in the palace. We entered the palace\r\nat noon, which is when most people go to pay taxes.\r\nThousands of people were milling around paying their\r\ntaxes, getting registered and doing things that had to\r\ndo with business. The workers in the palace maintained\r\na very positive attitude.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n<strong>The negotiations were based on several goals.</strong> One of\r\nthe main goals was to free political prisoners. The Sandinista\r\nFront had the tradition of never leaving its\r\nmilitants in prison. There was always a tradition of\r\nfighting politically for their liberty as well as one of taking\r\naction to get them out of jail. So our companeros\r\nwere our first priority. Secondly, we wanted money that\r\nwould help us to finance the struggle against Somocismo.\r\nBut money was not the primary objective. The essential\r\nobjective in the operation was to propose an alternative\r\nto a maneuver underway at the time. There was\r\nan effort to seek the displacement of Somoza while leaving\r\nthe political and military structure of Somocismo intact,\r\nputting any old civilian president in office to keep\r\nup the act. We called this Somocismo without Somoza.\r\nSeveral" \r\n</p>\r\n</td></tr></table>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="The View from Dora Maria Tellez II"></div>\r\n\r\n<table style="border-spacing: 10px;position:relative;top:-15px;"> <tr><td width=33%  valign="top">\r\n<p class="entry" style="font-size:.95em;-webkit-margin-before: .5em;">\r\n"groups had joined this maneuver: the financial\r\nbourgeoisie, other members of the bourgeoisie, several\r\nreligious groups and political parties. We felt that it was\r\nvery important to emphasize armed struggle as an essential\r\nalternative to overthrow the dictatorship, to present\r\nthe FSLN's program and to present a document to the\r\npeople and to the world which could explain what kind\r\nof maneuver was being undertaken, by whom, and how\r\nthis could be confronted.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nWe were able to transmit this message nationally, and\r\nit even had an international impact. So the negotiations\r\nrevolved around the publication of the documents which\r\nwe thought essential, and the liberation of political\r\nprisoners. There was no way out of this action; we had\r\nno retreat planned. There was no other alternative except\r\nto go ahead with the action or die. Obviously, the\r\ndictatorship rejected the publication of the documents\r\nand the prisoners' release. They wanted to try to attack,\r\nbut Anastasio Somoza had a nephew in there. And\r\nwhether Somoza yielded or not, he was being pressured\r\nby his own congressmen who were inside the Congress,\r\nand by the families who were outside. So the negotiations\r\ndragged on. They were trying to buy time to throw\r\nus out. But they didn't know how many of us there were.\r\nWe developed a technique which was to rotate those who\r\nwere guarding the doors and other places. Since we were\r\nalways changing places, people thought that there were\r\nfresh replacements, when in fact we were rotating. It\r\ngave the impression that there were a lot more of us\r\nthan there really were. Three bishops participated in the\r\nnegotiations, as well as the ambassadors of Venezuela,\r\nPanama and Spain.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nI can't remember how long in all, but it lasted about\r\n52 hours, a little over two days.\r\n</p>\r\n</td>\r\n\r\n<td width="66%">\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/nicaraguanptellez-v2.jpg">\r\n<p class="entry columns"  style="font-size:.95em;">&emsp;\r\n[On Staying Awake] <strong>That was very difficult. You know if you fall asleep,\r\nthey can kill you.</strong> The levels of tension and the very\r\ninstinct to survive keep you awake indefinitely. Otherwise\r\nit would be practically impossible. I began to sleep\r\nonly after leaving the palace, when we had almost\r\nreached Panama on the plane. The pressure during the\r\nnegotiations was intense; there were sporadic attacks\r\non the palace. They tried to get the mediators to make\r\nus retreat from our position. They didn't want to publish\r\nthe documents. It was a struggle. Of course, we knew\r\nthat they would have to yield.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were two feelings. On one hand, you were more\r\nafraid than inside the palace, because you were on a bus\r\nand much more vulnerable because you couldn't move.\r\nOf course you were travelling with bishops, you had\r\nhostages with you, but Somocismo could not be trusted.\r\nAnd on the other hand, there was an emotion which I\r\nthink is one of the greatest emotions I have had in my\r\nlife, to see the people in the street, defying the dictatorship.\r\nPeople were happy, celebrating in the streets.\r\nThere are two feelings which I have never been able\r\nto write down, and maybe I will never be able to write\r\ndown, those I felt on that day and on July 19, 1979,\r\nthe day of the victory. Both were very strong, full and\r\nvital emotions. And they were very significant, things\r\nwhich you can never repeat, and which can never be\r\nreproduced."</p>	large	f

With them was Major Mario Denis Moran, head of the intelligence section of the Salvadoran National Guard and a military classmate of Roberto D'Aubuisson, then leader of the right wing ARENA party; Lieutenant Isidoro Lopez Sibrian, Major Moran's second-in-command; and Captain Eduardo Ernesto Alfonso Avila, also a D'Aubuisson associate.\r\n<br>\r\nIt is believed that Hans Christ, the businessman, first spotted and recognized the labor advisors. About thirty minutes later, Capt. Avila and Lt. Lopez Sibrian walked to the front of the hotel where two bodyguards were waiting. The officers gave these two National Guardsmen Ingram submachine guns equipped with silencers. Lt. Lopez Sibrian then ordered the killings and Has Christ led the Guardsmen through the hotel and physically pointed out the victims. The Guardsmen stepped through the door of the dining room and machine-gunned Hammer, Pearlman and Viera to death.\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Salvadoran Guardsmen who actually carried out the killing, Valle Acevedo and Gomez Gonzalez, eventually served short terms in prison for their crimes. Major Moran, Captain Avila, and Lt. Sibrian were never charged, despite the American Embassy presenting two new witnesses who gave sworn testimony that Captain Avila had confessed a direct role in the killings to them. According to the 1993 UN Truth Commission Report on El Salvador, the US Army trained all three at the School of the Americas (SOA).\r\n<br>\r\n"In this time when the US government is trying to lead a worldwide campaign against terrorism, it is incumbent that we start by cleaning up our own backyard," stated Michael's brother, Frank Hammer, at the twenty-fifth anniversary. "To stop terrorism, we must stop exporting it ourselves."\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p style="font-size:small; padding:5px 10px;background:white;">1. The AIFLD came formally into being in 1961 and was technically under the direction of the American labor movement (AFL-CIO), but was soon being funded almost exclusively by the US government (AID) and serving consistently as a CIA instrument in most countries of Latin America. \r\nThere was no direct evidence that Hammer or Pearlman were working with the CIA, although an odd incident shortly after their murder raised the issue. In January 1981, Solicitor General Wade H. McCree ]r., testifying on the need for a law that would make it a\r\ncrime to reveal the names of CIA operatives, cited Hammer and Pearlman as examples of people who had been operating “under cover.” Later he denied that he had meant to imply they were working for the CIA.

The CIA and the Defense Department arrange for Israel to transfer captured PLO weapons to contras. Known as &quot;Operation Tipped Kettle,&quot; the deal is overseen by Richard Secord, who had just retired from the military under a cloud of scandal.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title=""></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\n<strong>The truth about Israel, Iran and 1980s U.S. arms deals\r\n<i>Recently declassified Pentagon documents reveal a strange, not to say illicit, 1980s operation called 'Tipped Kettle,' in which weapons stolen by Israel from the PLO in Lebanon were transferred to the Contras and to anti-American elements in Iran</i>\r\nBy Amir Oren Nov. 26, 2010</strong>\r\nThe collection of declassified documents published two weeks ago by the Pentagon reveals infighting among branches of the U.S. administration and intrigues in foreign countries - including 1980s' Israel. The impression one gets is not especially positive. The Americans are publishing the documents now not because they are trying somehow to suggest to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu how he should behave, but because the law obligates them to reveal records in due course following a review, unless there is a genuine reason to keep them secret. In the aforesaid period Netanyahu served as deputy to Moshe Arens, when he was Israel's ambassador to Washington, D.C. (1982-83 ). Arens' staff then also included Gen. Menachem Meron, the military attache in Washington, and spokesman Nachman Shai. Arens and his aides constituted an island of sanity in their relations with the administration of U.S. President Ronald Reagan, at a time of hostility in the U.S. capital toward the government of Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Defense Minister Ariel Sharon.\r\n<br>\r\nThe recently revealed documents deal with an operation dubbed "Tipped Kettle," involving weapons the Israel Defense Forces looted from the Palestine Liberation Organization during Operation Peace for Galilee in Lebanon, and their transfer to the Contras - opponents of the socialistic Sandinista regime in Nicaragua. That was the first episode, of rather questionable legality according to U.S. law, in a more complex story whose second installment, in 1985-1986, became known as the Iran-Contra scandal. Part II was patently illegal - a blatant effort by the White House to violate a Congressional order and to cook up a strange deal involving the sale of American weapons (originally supplied to the IDF ) to anti-American Iran, for use in its war with Iraq; the release of Western hostages being held in Lebanon by Iranian-controlled Hezbollah; and the financing of Contras' activities thanks to the difference between the sum paid by the Iranians and the true value of the weapons - minus a profit for those engaged in the deal.\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of that decade, during the trial of U.S. Marine Col. Oliver North and other officials in the Reagan administration, charged with deceiving Congress and providing false testimony to a special prosecutor, Operation Tipped Kettle was also briefly mentioned in the court proceedings. Now, however, the whole picture has come into view, with its emphasis on the behavior on the Israeli side.\r\n<br>\r\nIn the fall of 1982, Reagan's secretary of defense, Caspar Weinberger, was trying to implement a policy intended to combat pro-Soviet elements in Latin America, including the Sandinistas. Even more belligerent than he was CIA director William Casey. The CIA had direct intelligence connections with the Mossad, but in the affair of the captured weapons the American agency preferred to hide behind the Pentagon. The system of communication between the CIA and the Pentagon was called Focal Point; it had been used to facilitate connections between them since the mid-1950s. Officially, Israel was unaware then that the weapons taken from the PLO would be used not by the U.S. Army in its training bases, but rather to arm the Contras.</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title=""></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\nThough the Republicans controlled the White House at the time, the Democrats controlled Congress. The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Edward Boland, achieved a majority for a series of bills named for him, which limited the administration's ability to help the Contras. In one of the bills, passed in the fall of 1984, all U.S. intelligence agencies were prohibited from any such activity. (North tried to outsmart the law, claiming, after he came under investigation, that the National Security Council, which coordinated the operations, was not an intelligence agency. )\r\n\r\nThe legislation meant, in effect, that without the specific approval of Congress, no money could be formally budgeted in this case. Therefore, Casey, North and their colleagues had to use subterfuge to supply the arms, for example, by way of "donations" from foreign countries - Saudi Arabia, the Sultanate of Brunei - or circuitous deals with South Korea, Taiwan, China and especially Israel. The loot captured from the PLO during the war, at a cost of hundreds of Israeli dead, was particularly suitable for use by the Contras. And if Kalashnikov rifles fell into the hands of the Sandinistas, there would have been fewer questions about its source.\r\n\r\n'No policy problem'\r\n\r\nThe first of the Pentagon documents concerning Operation Tipped Kettle was sent by Weinberger to Casey on November 17, 1982. The subject: rifles, machine guns and light mortars for infantry fighters "captured by Israeli forces in Lebanon." The Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency "can offer assistance in helping to acquire significant amounts of these types of weapons presently available in Lebanon." The letter didn't say from whom exactly the weapons would be purchased - from the Christian Phalange forces, from other organizations or from Palestinians in areas outside IDF control. The State Department, added Weinberger, had "no policy problem with this effort as long as it is not publicized."\r\n\r\n"In a separate action, our efforts to obtain captured weapons directly from the Israeli government have been delayed while their military attache, MG Meron, is out of the Washington area. He should return within the next few days and the subject will be raised at that time ... We are prepared to meet your request through the Focal Point System," wrote Weinberger.\r\n\r\nIn March 1983, four months later, Weinberger sent Casey a second letter, declaring, "I am glad to report significant progress." In February, back in Israel, the Kahan Commission of inquiry report on the massacres in the Sabra and Chatila refugee camps in Beirut was submitted, as a consequence of which Ariel Sharon was dismissed as defense minister. At that point, staff from the embassy in Washington took over at the ministry in Tel Aviv: Arens was at the top, Meron became director general, and Shai was media adviser.\r\n\r\nWeinberger reported that "a joint DoD/CIA survey team visited Israel and was shown about 300 metric tons of captured weapons and ammunition suitable for your purposes. Shortly after Ambassador Arens became the new Israeli MOD, the DoD was informed that these weapons would be provided to the U.S. at a small percentage of their market value. This charge, which I understand will be agency funded, would only be for packing and handling and is anticipated to be in the neighborhood of $100,000. My staff is in the process of setting up the movement of these weapons to the U.S. Due to the weight and bulk of these items they will have to be moved by surface transport and thereby will not be available until the May/June timeframe."\r\n\r\nThat same day, the U.S. Navy was instructed to provide transport for "military items ... that will be shipped from the Israeli port of Ashdod ... to the East Coast of the United States."</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title=""></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\nWeinberger updated Casey: "The shipment will be available for CIA pickup" and "can remain packed in the 34 Land/Sea containers until reaching their destination. The Land/Sea containers are the property of the Government of Israel and will need to be ... returned to Israel."\r\n\r\nThe shipment included 20,000 rifles and submachine guns, 1,000 machine guns, 90 recoil-less rifles, 110 mortars, 1,000 hand grenades and a large amount of ammunition. "The then newly appointed Israeli minister of defense, Moshe Arens, made the final decision that these weapons were to be provided on a gratis basis to DoD. This was one of MOD Arens' first actions ... and was clearly a signal of his desire to improve U.S./Israel relations," according to the Pentagon documents.\r\n\r\nIsrael, with one-time and well-calculated generosity, did not lose much money here: In the 1980s, private arms dealers sold similar Kalashnikov rifles, made in Yugoslavia, for $210 each. The market value of all the Kalashnikovs in the shipment in question was only about $4 million; 60-mm. mortars were sold for about $1,500 and 81-mm. mortars for about $5,000.\r\n\r\nAdded costs\r\n\r\nA year later, the CIA's appetite was whetted again; now there were additional factors in the equation. Weinberger's new undersecretary for international security, Richard Armitage, became a close friend and regular visitor of the new military attache, Gen. Uri Simhoni; the same was true of Weinberger's senior military assistant, Gen. Colin Powell.\r\n\r\nIn June 1984, Weinberger received a memo from Armitage describing the process by which the looted weapons had been transferred a year earlier. Armitage mentioned that the mission was accomplished as a result of talks between Maj. Gen. Richard Secord and Meron, and a decision by Arens. In February 1984 the Pentagon was asked to find out whether there were additional weapons available in Israel "under the same financial terms" - i.e., "available for operational use at little or no cost." In contacts with the Israeli government a few months earlier, in March, it turned out that there were additional weapons stolen from the PLO caches, including Katyushas and anti-aircraft weapons, but that they were "for sale." A joint Pentagon-CIA survey delegation, headed by the liaison officer with Israel (whose name is erased, apparently a Col. Forster ), went to Israel to examine the items.\r\n\r\n"Contacts with the GOI," noted Armitage dryly, "revealed that they had placed a value of over $77M on these weapons, while DoD sources estimated the cost of the weapons at around $27M." Or, according to another estimate, $35 million. The head of the U.S. Army Museum, an expert on Soviet weapons, estimated the value at only $17 million.\r\n\r\nArmitage's deputy, U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. Edward Tixier, Secord's successor, was traveling to Israel to discuss a different matter and said he would speak privately to director general Meron to discuss transferring the second collection of captured weapons to the Pentagon at little or no cost. If Tixier succeeded, the weapons could arrive in the U.S. at the end of July and be sent immediately to the CIA.\r\n\r\nPrior to the Armitage-Simhoni meeting on May 24, Armitage wrote to a liaison officer subordinate to him that "the chances of the U.S. ever obtaining these weapons is poor if they are not in our possession by July 23, 1984 (the date of the upcoming Israeli election ). Our contacts in the Israel MOD (to include both Mr. Arens and Gen. Meron ) could be gone the following day, and establishing relations with new players could be time-consuming."</p>\r\n<br><div class="page" data-title=""></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\nAccording to the recently declassified documents, Israeli activity was frozen at the time, because of "the confusion in the GOI over what direction U.S. policy in Central America is heading and the role that Israel can and should play in relation to the topic. If you feel that timing is right you may which to discuss the issue of payment for these weapons. Because Israeli funds would have to be found to cover specific project related costs (packing, crating, shipping ), we should offer to pay these line items. We should not offer to pay anything for the weapons for two reasons: the weapons will be used to further Western interests, and in the grand scheme of U.S./Israeli relations, a good will gesture on the part of Israel (at a low dollar cost for them ) would be most helpful with the GOI is requesting U.S. assistance on major projects such as funding for the new SAAR-5 missile-attack boat, the Lavi, the F-4 upgrade, the upgrading of the Merkava tank, and the usage of FMS funds off-shore, to mention a few.\r\n\r\n"Prior to moving any of this equipment, there needs to be a lead time of several weeks, so that our EOD [explosive ordnance disposal] and logistics people can do the planning required to make this operation work. There is no time to spare if we are to complete this effort prior to Israeli elections."\r\n\r\nIn order to save time, Meron suggested that packing of the weaponry begin - this time, over 100 containers were needed - while internal consultation in Israel continued.\r\n\r\nThe Arens-Meron camp, the Americans reported to their dispatchers, had two problems: IDF Chief of Staff Moshe Levi, eager to speed up the withdrawal of the IDF from Lebanon, gave top priority to establishing a security zone and therefore also arming of the forces of Saad Hadad - which became the South Lebanon Army - with the weapons in question. The IDF's security assistance unit, headed by Col. (res. ) Zvi Reuter, and foreign relations department, demanded monetary compensation. Above all, the clock was ticking: Soon there would be a new Knesset and perhaps a new defense minister, who would bring in a new director general.\r\n\r\nIn the last telegram from Tel Aviv, bearing the censored signature of the liaison officer, there is an hour-by-hour description of the consultations, maneuvering and bargaining: hints that the price could be reduced if a way could be found to increase the aid; anger in the Pentagon at the Israeli chutzpah; examination of alternatives; encrypted telegrams from the embassy; bridging proposals; a "gentlemen's agreement" without signatures.\r\n\r\nThe elections came and went and the race between Labor, headed by Shimon Peres, and Likud, headed by Yitzhak Shamir, ended in a tie. A week later, before the Peres-Shamir government was formed, Arens signed an approval of the transaction: Weapons worth $30 million to $40 million in exchange for the expectation of an increase in military assistance. Arens was forced to vacate the ministry in favor of Yitzhak Rabin, who like him was pro-American, but Meron remained in the post of director general for two more years.\r\n\r\nThe Tipped Kettle papers end with an internal memo, with no addressees or signatories, which was written on the day the Iran-Contra affair was exposed, in November 1986. It reports that Reuter, the head of security assistance , complained that the debt for the second transaction had yet to be paid. The complaint was examined in the Pentagon and it revealed an astonishing finding. The Israeli military attache's office in Washington and the international branch of the Defense Department had reached a secret arrangement: In return for Israel waiving the payment, the U.S. defense contractor Numax was to retain its security clearance and government contracts after being purchased by Israel.\r\n\r\nWhat the officers and ministers, the officials and ambassadors are doing in secret today will be revealed, thanks to the Americans in another 25 years.\r\n</p>	large	t

719	Contadora Group Formed	1983	1983	ven1	event	Hazel Smith, 'The Conservative Approach: Sandinista Nicaragua's Foreign Policy'	<div class="page" data-title="Trying for Peace"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="background-color:white;padding:6px;position:relative;top:190px;">\r\n&emsp; The beginnings of the Contadora Group surged forth in January of 1983.  The seeds were planted by the Colombian Nobel Prize winner for Literature, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Alfonso Garcia Robles from Mexico, Nobel Prize winner, Alba Myrdal and Sweden's Prime Minister, Olof Palme.  They called for the Presidents of Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela and Panama to act as mediators in the Central American conflict and to seek negotiated end to the Nicaraguan war.  The stated purpose of Contadora was to find a peaceful solution to the regional crisis, and in particular, to promote peaceful coexistence between Sandinista Nicaragua on the one hand and the United States with its Central American allies on the other, but the group's emphasis on <i>peaceful</i> coexistence with Nicaragua ran counter to the increasingly hard-line anti-Sandinista posture emanating from Washington.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe Contadora Group issued its first set of proposals in July 1983. It proposed the withdrawal of all foreign military advisers from Central America, the end of all aid to irregular forces, and the cessation of tension generating military maneuvers in the border regions. In September 1983 the Contadora Group produced a draft 21-point peace treaty which was drawn up after consultation with the Central American carnal. This 'Document of Objectives' was primarily concerned with security issues, although the treaty included some references to internal issues such as promoting national reconciliation, the establishment of 'democratic, representative and pluralistic systems', and respect for human rights. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThese peace proposals were accompanied by intense regional diplomatic activity. The Contadora Group met eleven times in 1983. The Central American foreign ministers met six times as part of the Contadora process. The technical commission, composed of representative from all the Central American countries met four times. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn July 1983 the Nicaraguan government issued a six-point peace pro-posal incorporating the July Contadora proposals, and calling again for the immediate signing of a non-aggression pace between Honduras and Nicaragua. In December 1983, Nicaragua submitted eight draft peace treaties to the Contadora Group, calling for peace agreements to be negotiated within Central America and with the United States. In January 1984 the Contadora Group and the Central American nations attempted to strengthen the process by creating three joint committees, to deal with security, political, and social and economic issues.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn June 1984 Contadora presented its 'Draft Act on Peace and Coop-eration'. After amendments from all five republics were incorporated into a September revised act, Guatemala and Costa Rica both agreed to sign. Of the five governments, Nicaragua had been one of the most critical of the revised act, \r\ndisliking the Act's proposal for international monitoring of internal political processes and openly unhappy at the prospect of establishing regionally-defined force limits while direct US military pressures and the war with the "Contra" rebels continued.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="The Masters of War"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="background-color:white;padding:6px;position:relative;top:280px;">\r\n\r\n&emsp;\r\nYet on 21 September 1984, it was the Nicaraguan government which became the first of the five to sign the Act. The US reacted to this entirely unexpected decision by persuading Honduras to convene a meeting of the Central American countries, again excluding Nicaragua. In October 1984 Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica produced the `Tegucigalpa document' which contained a series of amendments to the Contadora Ace designed to weaken its impact and legitimise a continuing US military presence in the region. The US had objected to those parts of the Act which prohibited international military exercises and foreign military bases and which called for the immediate cessation of arms acquisitions. The Tegucigalpa document proposed to `regulate' military exercises as opposed to ending them. It also would have allowed for a continuation of foreign military bases in the region. A leaked US National Security Council Document discussed how, through intensive US regional diplomacy, 'We have effectively blocked efforts made by the Contadora Group to impose their second version of the Contadora Act.\r\n<br>&emsp;The Contadora Group carried on meeting throughout 1985, although it faced continued intransigence from the United States, which initiated more massive military exercises in Honduras in February 1985. In April 1985, the United States attempted to transfer the peace process from within the framework of the Contadora process to the OAS. The only support for this proposal came from Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica and the now pro-US Grenada. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn June and July 1985, vice-president Sergio Ramirez embarked on a tour of Latin America in an effort to retake the diplomatic initiative and revive active support for the peace process. Asa result of this visit, Argentina, Brasil, Peru and Uruguay agreed to create a support group for the Contadora process, the 'Lima Group'. Collectively the Contadora and Lima Groups became known as the 'Group of 8'. Attempts by the United Stares to enlarge the group to include the more pro-US Ecuador and the Dominican Republic were unsuccessful." \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe formation of the Lima Group gave an impetus to the search for peace, at more or less the same time that the United States Congress approved a massive $100 million of contra aid. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n	large	t
729	Monge's Neutrality Proclamation	1983	1983	cos1	power		Sept. 15: Monge's Neutrality Proclamation.  The  Monge administration was clearly inclined to intervene more directly against   the contra camps on its border once death-squad style murders of leftist Costa   Rican citizens and burning and looting of stores owned by contra supporters   began. The Monge administration moved consistently after mid-1983 toward a more   effectively neutral position vis a vis the Nicraguan border fighting in   particular, and the Central American crisis in general. This move was opposed   throughout by the United States and important Rightist elements within Costa   Rica, and even within the administration itself. TEXT OF COSTA RICAN NEUTRALTY STATUTE  &quot;We declare that Costa Rica will observe neutrality in all   armed conflicts affecting the states of the international   community, subject to the following:   Active   Our neutrality does not imply impartiality in ideological   and political conflicts in the world. Costa Rica has   maintained and will continue to maintain the political and   social concepts it shares with Western democracies. This   neutrality will not prevent it from actively exercising its   rights as a member of the United Nations and the OAS in all   actions aimed at preserving international peace and security,   except those having military implications; at achieving a more   just social and economic system in relations among states; and   at the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms.   Autonomous   Our neutrality is based on our sovereignty. Our country   does not recognize the right of any state to interpret the   consequences of this declaration of neutrality to determine,   define, or limit our country's foreign policy, either at the   United Nations and its agencies, at the OAS, or in bilateral   relations with other states. We ratify the obligations   imposed on us by international treaties and pacts that we have   signed, and we request that in the collective security systems   to which we belong we be freed from participating in military   actions, which we have not taken Part in for more than 30 years because we do not have an army.

731	La Penca	1983	1983	incos2	power	Hostile Acts: U. S. Policy in Costa Rica in the 1980s By Martha Honey and THE GUERRILLA WARS OF CENTRAL AMERICA by Saul Landau	<div class="page" data-title=Dirty Tricks"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="position:relative;top:190px;background-color: rgba(255,255,255,.7);padding:10px;">Oct. 1, 1983 <br>\r\nImmigration records show La Penca terrorists, &quot;Per Anker Hansen&quot; and &quot;Patricia Anne Boone Mariscot&quot; first arrive in Costa Rica.  For the CIA and North network, la Penca signals the point at which Costa Rica is converted from a base for conventional warfare against Nicaragua into an arena for "unconventional" warfare. Before La Penca, the United States had been attempting to build up the Southern Front as the mirror image of the Northern Front in Honduras with a large, uniﬁed, conventional contra army. Afterward the Sandinistas launched a major offensive against ARDE, sending hundreds of guerrillas fleeing into Costa Rica. Political in-fighting, the bombing, and the Sandinista assault left ARDE badly crippled. \r\n<br>\r\nHowever, rather than regrouping and rebuilding the Southern Front forces, U.S. strategists moved, over the coming months, to swiftly dismantle those that remained and to replace them with a small "dirty tricks" network whose main task was not to fight against the Sandinista army but to stage terrorist actions designed to be blamed on the Sandinistas. In the process Costa Rica, the region's only real democracy, was to become the base for what is known in the covert trade as "simulated terrorism," actions designed to be blamed on one’s enemy and to cause a public outcry. Simulated terrorism is a well-established CIA tactic. Miami Cubans involved with the Southern Front adopted it in their war against Fidel Castro, John Hull employed it as a CIA operative in Brazil, and the contras used it in border incidents.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<span style="background:yellow;">\r\nIn late May 1984 Pastora took a boatload of reporters to a jungle hideout on the Costa Rican-Nicaraguan border. Once ashore at a tiny town called La Penca the crowd assembled, the reporters took out their tape recorders, the TV men unloaded their cameras. One man posing as a photographer for a European magazine excused himself, saying he had left something in the launch. It was then the bomb went off. Pastora was injured, and three reporters lay dead. Several more were wounded. The suspected assassin pretended on the boat ride back from the jungle hideout that he had also been injured. By the time the police began to look for him, he had disappeared. The bomber took advantage of the confusion that ensued when the wounded and dead were taken from the boats and rushed to hospitals and morgues to leave Costa Rica.\r\n</span> \r\n<br><i>Pictured above, left to right: Eden Pastora, ARDE group leader giving statements to the Costa Rican and international press, aftermath of bombing, and wounded journalist Edgar Fonseca Monge.</i><br><span style="color:#cc0000;">continued &#10159;</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="The Farms"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="position:relative;top:190px;background-color: rgba(255,255,255,.7);padding:10px;">\r\nAfter La Penca, the CIA/North/Hull network laid plans an ambitious program of terrorism: a 1985 assassination attempt on Pastora, a phony "Sandinista" attack on the border town of Los Chilies, a series of bombings against the U.S. embassies in Costa Rica and Honduras, and the murders of U.S., Costa Rican, and contra officials in both these countries.  Parallel to these plots, this same group became increasingly involved in drug trafficking for both personal proﬁt and to help finance the contra war after Congress cut off funding. Contra operations provided a perfect womb for securely moving cocaine from Colombia through Costa Rica to the United States: personnel, airplanes, landing strips, loose financial records, and, most important, protection under the aegis of a clandestine CIA operation. In Costa Rica, guardsmen and contras protected private landing strips and farms in Guanacaste and San Carlos that were used for arms deliveries and military. \r\n<br>On some of these same farms, planes were reloaded with sacks of cocaine for their return run to the States. When planes landed at commercial or military airports in the United States, DEA and customs agents were routinely kept away, told not to inspect because this was a covert Agency mission. In some cases, CIA operatives within the anti-Sandinista network made deals to give drug cartel officials immunity from prosecution. In return, drug dollars flowed into the contras’ war chest and into the private bank accounts of certain rebel leaders and CIA oficials. As Miami-based former federal attorney John Mattes put it, "There was a marriage of convenience between the contras and the coke smugglers. The smugglers had access to intelligence, airstrips, and, most importantly, unimpeded access into the U.S. And that to a drug smuggler is worth all the tea in China." These activities—terrorism and drug trafficking—were among the most closely guarded secrets of the Iran-contra scandal. <br>\r\nThe La Penca bombing represented the union of U.S.-sponsored murder and narcotics smuggling under the banner of ﬁghting communism, but la Penca itself was just one event in a much broader and more complex panorama. Even after years of our own investigations, coupled with those of the Christic Institute and other journalists and researchers, as well as judicial and congressional inquiries in both the United States and Costa Rica, many mysteries remain. But enough had been revealed about the underworld surrounding Washington's war against Nicaragua to show that, as the young frightened contra "David" whispered to Carlos Rojas, "These people are involved in drug and arms trafficking and they are making money off the blood of my brothers."</p>	large	f

751	NSC adviser Robert McFarlane secures Saudi pledge $1 million a month to contras. 	1984	1984	mie1	economy		<strong>MAY 1984</strong> NSC adviser Robert McFarlane secures Saudi pledge $1 million a month to contras. \r\n<p class="columns3">\r\n<strong>The Back Story...</strong>\r\nThe CIA attempted to circumvent the congressional constraints upon its actions but did not do a very good job of hiding its\r\ninvolvement. It made the mistake of bringing in retired Special Forces veterans who had served in Vietnam. In one embarrassing\r\nepisode, they convinced the Agency to translate into Spanish an old comic book instructing Vietnamese peasants on ways to take\r\nover a village by murdering the mayor, chief of police, and militia. The CIA distributed a Spanish-language version of this\r\n“Freedom Fighter's Manual” to the contras. Some ended up in the hands of opponents of the U.S. wars in Central America, who\r\nmade them public. Americans also learned that the CIA had mined Nicaraguan harbors, which provoked conservative icon\r\nBarry Goldwater to scold Casey. “I am pissed off,” he wrote. “This is an act violating international law. It is an act of War."\r\n<br>\r\nCongress reacted in October 1984 by strengthening the Boland Amendment and cutting off all aid to the contras. In order to\r\ntie Casey's hands, Congress explicitly prohibited any intelligence agency from soliciting funds from “any nation, group,\r\norganization, movement, or individual.” Chief of Staff James Baker feared that administration “crazies” would nonetheless solicit\r\nfunds from other countries, which Casey, McFarlane, and North proceeded to do. Saudi Arabia provided the lion’s share, but\r\nother nations, including Apartheid South Africa, Israel, and Taiwan, pledged millions of dollars more. Shultz had warned Reagan that\r\napproving further assistance would constitute an impeachable offense. But Casey, Bush, and Reagan all pooh-poohed that\r\nnotion.\r\n</p>\r\n	large	f

The Bedouin King was the largest single contributor to the contras. Congressional investigators traced a total of $33.6 million that passed through Adolfo Calero's FDN bank account. Of that amount, $32 million was received from Saudi Arabia. It was a small price to pay for continued U.S. military support for his regime. Fahd gave many times that amount to the Afghan Mujahadeen, another U.S.-backed\r\nanti-communist force.\r\n<br>\r\nThe man who opened the doors to the Mullah's moolah was General Richard Secord. As the head of the Pentagon's foreign military sales program from 1978 to 1981, Secord oversaw the sales of billions of dollars in military equipment to the nations of the Middle East. In 1981, Secord and Oliver North successfully lobbied Congress to support the $8.5 billion sale of AWACS surveillance planes to Saudi Arabia over the stiff objection of the Israeli lobby, thus assuring King Fahd's support of the contras.\r\n<br>\r\nKing Fahd is the world's second richest monarch, with a personal fortune estimated at $20 billion. The world's weahhlest monarch is the Suhan of Brunei, a tiny oil-rich country near Borneo.

In return the United States would pledge to halt shipments of arms to the contras. This proposal received wide media acclaim as fair and just; the Iran-contra hearings that had concluded two days earlier had passed into ancient history, along with their suggestion that a U.S. pledge might be worth less than gold. Nevertheless, to the surprise and annoyance of the administration, the Central American presidents reached an agreement on August 7.  \r\n<br>&emsp;Government propaganda then shifted, predictably, to the demolition of the unacceptable accords. The media followed faithfully along. I have reviewed the details elsewhere, so I will only summarize this most remarkable campaign.  \r\n<br>&emsp;The problem to be addressed was a familiar one: a great power has been unable to impose its will and finds itself confronted with conditions and circumstances that it refuses to accept. A state that commands unusual power, such as the United States, has a variety of ways to deal with the problem. One is to pretend that the adversary has capitulated, accepting the U.S. stand. This option can be pursued only if the information system can be trusted to fall into line, presenting the U.S. government version as if it were true, however outlandish the pretense. If the media meet their responsibilities in this way, then the adversary must indeed accept U.S. terms, or else suffer retribution for violating the alleged solemn commitment to adhere to them.  \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOne striking example of this technique was the treatment of the Paris peace treaty of January 1973, which the United States was compelled to sign after the failure of its attempt to bludgeon North Vietnam into submission by the Christmas B-52 bombings of populated areas. The U.S. government at once offered a version of the treaty that was diametrically opposed to its terms on every crucial point. This version was uniformly accepted and promulgated by the media, so that the actual terms of the peace treaty had been dismissed to the memory hole literally within a few days. The United States and its South Vietnamese client then proceeded with massive violations of the actual treaty in an effort to attain their long-sought goals by violence, and when the Vietnamese adversaries finally responded in kind, they were universally denounced for the breakdown of the agreements and compelled to suffer for their crime. The case of the Central America peace accords was similar. It was necessary to refashion them to conform to U.S. dictates, a task that was accomplished with the anticipated cooperation of the media, though it took a little longer than the overnight victory at the time of the Paris peace accords–perhaps an indication that the media really have become more &quot;adversarial&quot; than in the past.  \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe first requirement of the demolition campaign was to establish that it was U.S. support for the contras that had forced the Sandinistas to negotiate. This is always an important doctrine, since it can be exploited to justify subsequent resort to armed force and terror. The thesis hardly withstands the evidence of history: Nicaragua's effort to pursue the peaceful means required by international law through the World Court, the United Nations, and the Contadora process, and Washington's success in &quot;trumping&quot; these initiatives. Such problems were readily overcome by dismissal of the facts to the memory hole. The required doctrinal truth then became the merest cliché. The New York Times editors could therefore criticize Michael Dukakis during the 1988 election campaign because he &quot;undervalues the role of force in bringing the Sandinistas to the bargaining table.&quot; It would be unreasonable to expect troublesome facts to stand in the way of a principle that authorizes continued reliance on violence as the necessary means for bringing peace. More generally, what is useful is True. Period.  \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe first task was accomplished with dispatch. The next problem was to dismantle the accords themselves. Their first phase ran from the signing in August 1987 to January 1988, when the Central American presidents were to receive the report of the International Verification Commission (CIVS), which was charged with monitoring the accords. The goal of the Reagan administration was to focus all attention on the Sandinistas, thus ensuring that the United States could maintain the attack by its proxy forces and exclude the U.S. client states from the provisions of the accords. The media at once dedicated themselves to these further tasks, and by January the last shreds of the original accords disappeared, replaced by the initial U.S. terms. Henceforth, the irrelevant facts become of interest only to archivists. It is the necessary illusions that prevail.  \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe peace plan specified one &quot;indispensable element&quot; for peace, namely, a termination of open or covert aid of any form (&quot;military, logistical, financial, propagandistic&quot;) to &quot;irregular forces&quot; (the contras) or &quot;insurrectionist movements&quot; (indigenous guerrillas). In response, the United States at once stepped up its illegal CIA supply flights, which had already reached the phenomenal level of one a day in an effort to keep the proxy forces in the field. These doubled in September and virtually tripled in the months that followed. Surveillance flights also increased. Successes were immediately evident as contra attacks on civilians doubled in intensity, including ambushes, murders, attacks on farm cooperatives, and kidnappings. The CIA also offered bribes to Miskito leaders to prevent them from joining the peace process.  \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe peace agreements were thus effectively dead from the first moment. These were, by far, the most significant developments during the August-January phase of the accords. <br>\r\n<span class="entry_source">Necessary Illusions, Noam Chomsky</span></p>	large	f

The White House declared that President Bush has "complete confidence" in CIA Director William H. Webster.</p>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size: .95em;background-color:white;">\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/williamwebsterbush.jpg" class="floatright">\r\n&emsp;William H. Webster, the Director of Central Intelligence, called today on the President and Congress to consider giving the Central Intelligence Agency greater latitude in supporting potentially violent efforts to overthrow foreign dictators.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nMr. Webster, in an interview, said a longstanding Presidential executive order barring American involvement in assassinations had been interpreted to prohibit American assistance to any coup that could lead to the death of a country's leader, even in the heat of battle.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAsked if he would like to see this interpretation relaxed, Mr. Webster said, ''I don't think you're misreading me.''\r\n<br>\r\n...\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAdministration officials said that when the dissident Panamanian officers said this month that they were plotting a coup, C.I.A. officers in Panama were essentially barred from providing advice because of the possibility that the coup might lead to the death of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the country's leader.\r\n<br>\r\n...\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe first executive order on intelligence, as approved by President Ford on Feb. 18, 1976, said, ''No employee of the United States Government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, political assassination.'' Mr. Bush was the Director of Central Intelligence at the time.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe order's provisions were significantly strengthened in 1978 by President Carter to say that ''no person employed by or acting on behalf of the United States Government shall engage, or conspire to engage, in assassination.'' President Reagan retained that language in 1981 after a sharp dispute among his intelligence advisers.\r\n<br>\r\n...\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nMr. Webster, a former Federal judge, gave a detailed analysis of how he believed the executive order was interpreted at present.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nWhat is unequivocally barred, he said, is an American-devised plan for the assassination of General Noriega.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n''Now the next thing is, hire a guy to kill Noriega or fund a group who wants to kill Noriega,'' he said. ''Our executive order would have in the past been construed at least that we could not do that, because we would just be using someone else to do what we couldn't do ourselves.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n''Now it begins to get a little tighter when you say, 'Here's a group that says it doesn't plan to kill him, but they're going to have to play rough and it could happen.'\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n''Now we're in the area that has to be addressed.''\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn the interview, Mr. Webster said the C.I.A.'s assessment of the Panamanian coup leader, Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega, had concluded that he was a legitmate plotter whose plan was faulty and had less than a 50-50 chance of success. He acknowledged that the military's analysis of the situation placed greater emphasis on the possibility that Major Giroldi was part of an operation intended to entrap American military forces.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nWhen President Bush's senior advisers met on Oct. 2 to consider how to handle the coup, they concluded that it was best to proceed cautiously, largely because of the danger that Major Giroldi was not credible. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney represented the military. The C.I.A. was not included in the session.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAsked whether his agency should have been represented, Mr. Webster replied, ''That would have been the preferred option.'' But he said it made no difference in the outcome, because the C.I.A. analysis also suggested the need for caution.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAn Administration official said future crises of this sort would be handled by the Deputies Committee, a panel of senior officials that includes Richard Kerr, the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="caption"><i>Pictured</i>, William Webster with George H.W.

850	Daniel Ortega elected as president for the second time	2006	2006	nic2	power	<span style="color:white;">Counterpunch's The Betrayal of the Sandinista Revolution by ROGER BURBACH, the New York Times</span>	<div class="page" data-title="Re-election"></div>\r\n<p class="entry" style="width:460px;background-color:white;padding:9px;position:relative;left:-10px;">\r\nDaniel Ortega elected as president for the second time, this time under very different circumstances.\r\n<br>\r\nUpon his inauguration as Nicaraguan president in January 2007, Daniel Ortega asserted that his government would represent “the second stage of the Sandinista Revolution.” His election was full of symbolic resonance, coming after 16 years of electoral failures for Ortega and the party he led, the Sandinista Front for National Liberation (FSLN). The Sandinistas’ road to power was paved with a series of previously unthinkable pacts with the old somocista and Contra opposition. The FSLN’s pact making began in earnest in 2001, when, in the run-up to that year’s presidential election, Ortega forged an alliance with Arnoldo Alemán, an official during the Somoza regime who had been elected president in 1997.\r\n<br>\r\nBut even with Alemán’s backing, Ortega was unable to win the presidency. So, before the 2006 election, he publicly reconciled with his old nemesis, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, a potent symbol of the counterrevolutionary movement in the 1980s. Ortega and his longtime companion, Rosario Murillo, announced their conversion to Catholicism and were married by the cardinal. Just before his election Ortega supported a comprehensive ban on abortion, including in cases in which the mother’s life is endangered, a measure ratified by the legislature with the crucial votes of Sandinista deputies. To round out his pre-election wheeling and dealing, Ortega selected Jaime Morales, a former Contra leader, as his vice presidential candidate.\r\n<br>\r\nOrtega's political strategy includes targeting the dissident party Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS), cofounded by Dora María Tellez, former Minister of Health and legendary Sandinista commander.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Zoilamerica"></div>\r\n<table><tr><td>\r\n<p class="entry" style="width:350px;background-color:white;padding:9px;">\r\nIn 1998, Ortega's then 30-year-old stepdaughter, Zoilamerica Narvaez (née Ortega), <i>pictured</i>, publicly declared that during the years of his 1979-1990 presidency, while he was pursuing his socialist ideals for a better world and fighting the contra guerrillas backed by the United States, he was also sexually abusing her, a child he had adopted and raised as his own. ''I was constantly being warned that, if I said anything to anyone, I could jeopardize the revolution,'' she said. ''I was told that keeping this situation a secret was the way I contributed to the stability of the presidency. I was blackmailed all the time and I assumed that my role was to suffer and to keep silent.''\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Narvaez said the abuse began in 1978, the year she turned 11. The Sandinistas were in rebellion against the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza Debayle, and the family had moved to Costa Rica to protect their lives.\r\n<br>\r\nThe abuse, she said, continued after the Sandinistas took power in 1979, and it went on until 1990, the year Mr. Ortega was voted out of power and she married Mr. Bendana, who had been the Sandinistas' envoy to the United Nations. Verbal abuse, including almost nightly sexual propositions, went on until 1998.\r\n</td><td>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/zoilamericanarvaez-crop.jpg">\r\n</td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</p>\r\n	large	f

The Sandinista Revolution Betrayed  by Roger Burbach, NACLA	<p class="entry columns">\r\n2008 <br>\r\nSandinistas dominate the municipal elections. Many of the Sandinista mayors who were elected are critics of president Daniel Ortega, who has formed alliances with conservatives, signed new accords with the International Monetary Fund that do not modify the neoliberal paradigm (while the salaries of government workers remain frozen and those of teachers and health workers are the lowest in Central America), and punished feminist organizations fighting for women's reproductive rights.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the election, militant demonstrations erupted in Nicaragua’s two largest cities, Managua and León, and were quickly put down with violence. The European Economic Community and the U.S. government suspended funding for Nicaragua over the fraudulent elections. On January 14, before the election results were even officially published by the electoral council, Ortega swore in the new mayors at Managua’s Plaza de la Revolución. He declared: “This is the time to strengthen our institutions,” later adding, “We cannot go back to the road of war, to confrontation, to violence.” Along with the regular police, Ortega stood flanked by camisas rosadas, or redshirts, members of his personal security force. A huge banner hung over the plaza depicting Ortega with an up-stretched arm and the slogan, “To Be With the People Is to Be With God.”\r\n<br>\r\n“This despotic regime is bent on destroying all that is left of the Sandinista revolution’s democratic legacy,” Carlos Fernando Chamorro, the onetime director of the Sandinista party newspaper, told NACLA. “Standing in the way of a new dictatorship,” he continued, “are civil society organizations, the independent media, trade unions, opposition political parties, women’s organizations, civic leaders and others—many of whom can trace their roots back to the resistance against Somoza.”\r\n</p>	large	f

854	Expanded Military Presence	1943	1947	pue2	power	U.S. MILITARY BASES IN LATIN  AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN John Lindsay-Poland	<p class="entries columns">\r\nDuring World War II, the United States maintained as many as 63,000 troops in Panama and forced through an agreement to establish more than 100 military bases outside the Canal Zone in the interior of Panama, ostensibly to defend the canal. Some of these troops, however, were deployed for a project to test chemical weapons to see how they would behave in a tropical environment, in preparation for an anticipated chemical war with the Japanese in the Paciﬁc. From late 1943 through 1947, the army’s Chemical Warfare Service used San José Island – an unpopulated member of the Pearl Islands group – to ﬁre or drop thousands of chemical munitions. The San José Project used soldiers, many of them Puerto Rican, as human subjects in the tests, exposing them to mustard gas and other agents to measure how well masks and ointments functioned and even, in one case, “to determine whether any difference existed in the sensitivity of Puerto Rican and Continental U.S. Troops to H gas [mustard].”\r\n<br>\r\nSimilarly, the United States dramatically expanded its military presence in Puerto Rico in the period leading up to and during World War II, establishing the vast Roosevelt Roads Naval Station and expropriating lands for the bombing ranges and maneuver area on the islands of Vieques and Culebra (the latter already in use as a ﬁring range) . In fact, U.S. military facilities, especially airﬁelds, were established during the war in many nations throughout much of the hemisphere (Ecuador, Peru, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and in several British colonies in the Caribbean), an observation that bears comparison with the current growth of U.S. bases around the world in the “war on terror.”\r\n<br>\r\n After the war, most of the U.S. bases in the region that had been set up for the war were closed, but the navy kept its bases in Puerto Rico.\r\n</p>	large	f
855	The Failed  Multinational Counter-narcotics Center	1995	1997	pan2	power	U.S. MILITARY BASES IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN John Lindsay-Poland	<p class="entries columns">\r\nIn 1995, Washington opened discussions with Panama to retain military bases in Panama beyond 1999 for a complex \r\nthat would be called a Multinational Counter-narcotics Center. At its core, the United States sought the continued use of Howard Air Force Base for surveillance missions of the Andean countries and eastern Paciﬁc.\r\n<br>\r\nPanamanian president Ernesto Pérez Balladares showed ambivalence toward the project from the beginning, saying there \r\nwould be no bases without payment of rent. The “multinational” nature of the complex was largely a ﬁg leaf designed to appease Panamanian nationalist sympathies; officials said other Latin American governments would participate in the center, but they were never involved in the negotiations. While Washington went through several negotiators, Panamanian nationalist, human rights, and environmental groups organized coalitions to oppose the continued presence of U.S. troops. They agitated in the media, on the street, and in the ruling Revolutionary Democratic Party against the negotiations. U.S. and Panamanian officials announced an agreement in December 1997, but when its details were leaked the following month, support for it evaporated. The agreement called for unpaid use of extensive facilities in the canal area, U.S. jurisdiction for crimes committed by U.S. soldiers, and a provision allowed for “other missions” besides counter-drug activity. The deal collapsed, and the United States would have to find new sites.\r\n</p>	large	f
856	The Killing of Orlando Letelier and Ronni Moffitt	1976	1976	usa3	power		<p class="entry columns3">On September 21, 1976, a squad organized by the Chilean secret police assassinated Orlando Letelier, who had been Allende's ambassador to the United States and foreign minister, by detonating a bomb in his car as he drove near Dupont Circle in Washington.<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/orlandoleteliercar.jpg">\r\n<br>\r\nHis American assistant, Ronni Moffitt, was also killed. No such act of political terror had ever been committed in Washington, and it set off long and bitter condemnation of Pinochet's regime. Later it became clear that Letelier's murder was part of Operation Condor, a wider program to kill dissidents who were active outside of their home countries in Latin America.\r\n<br>\r\nFilmmaker Saul Landau: <i>My two colleagues, Orlando Letelier and Ronni Moffitt were assassinated in Washington, D.C., by Cuban exiles working for the Chilean secret police now. [H]e had been the Chilean ambassador in Washington. That’s where I first met him. And I had invited him to come to the Institute for Policy Studies, where I was working. And he did. And he wasn’t even there a year, and he was blown up in his car on Sheridan Circle, three-quarters of a mile from the White House—very audacious act of terrorism.\r\n<br>\r\n I had dinner with him on Sunday night. He was killed on Tuesday morning. And on that Sunday night, we had come out—my wife and I had come out of his house, and I remember talking outside with our elbows on his car, which was parked in the driveway, not knowing, of course, there was a bomb underneath the car.\r\n[A]ccording to the witnesses who later testified, they had put the car on late Saturday night—actually, early Sunday morning. They had placed the bomb on the car then.\r\n[T]hey missed him Monday somehow, and so they got him on Tuesday.\r\n<br>\r\nThe assassins came from a Cuban group in northern New Jersey, in Weehawken, called the Cuban Nationalist Movement. Sometimes they went under the name of Omega 7. And the FBI had infiltrated them and knew from early on in their investigation that they had been the actual perps who did the thing, under the auspices of the Chilean secret police, who had ordered the assassination.\r\n<br>\r\n[A]ccording to what we know from the FBI agents and from the FOIA stuff, they found out afterwards. The assassination was on a Tuesday. I think Friday or Saturday their informant called up and said that it was the Cuban Nationalist Movement who did the job, and then he named the people who did it: Guillermo Novo Sampol and his brother Ignacio and Alvin Ross and José Dionisio Suárez. They were all arrested by the FBI very quickly and held in contempt for refusing to testify. Then they were tried and convicted, three of them. And two later were caught and convicted. But then the Novos got out, because the prosecutor made a procedural error. And in the second trial, their lawyers apparently learned more than the prosecutors, and they got off. And it was at that point Guillermo Novo, in the hall, just right after the trial, looked at me and then, in Spanish, he said, "And now we’re going to get the rest of those commie SOBs." </i>\r\n<br>\r\nArmando Fernandez Larios, a member of a Chilean military squad responsible for the torture and execution of at least 72 political prisoners in the month following the 1973 coup, is now residing in the United States. Fernandez has publicly acknowledged his service as a member of the military squad, as well as his role as an agent of Chile's notorious secret police, the DINA, during the Pinochet regime. He struck a plea bargain with US government prosecutors, pleading guilty to being an "accessory after the fact" in the DINA-sponsored 1976 Washington, DC bombing murder of former Chilean dissident official Orlando Letelier. The Chilean government reportedly would like Fernandez extradited from the US, but his lawyer in Miami has said that the 1987 plea-agreement between his client and the Department of Justice stipulated that Fernandez would never be returned to Chile. Department of Justice officials have declined to comment on the degree of Fernandez's protection under the terms of the agreement, which is under court seal. Michael Townley of Chile played an even more significant role in the Letelier assassination. He served some time in a US prison and is now in the Federal Witness Protection Program.</p>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n"In such a context, concentration of wealth is no accident, but a rule; it is not the marginal outcome of a difficult situation&#8212;as they would like the world to believe&#8212;but the base for a social project; it is not an economic liability but a temporary political success. Their real failure is not their apparent inability to redistribute wealth or to generate a more even path of development (these are not their priorities) but their inability to convince the majority of Chileans that their policies are reasonable and necessary. In short, they have failed to destroy the consciousness of the Chilean people. The economic plan has had to be enforced, and in the Chilean context that could be done only by the killing of thousands, the establishment of concentration camps all over the country, the jailing of more than 100,000 persons in three years, the closing of trade unions and neighbourhood organizations, and the prohibition of all political activities and all forms of free expression."\r\n<br>\r\nOrlando Letelier, <A href="http://historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/letelierchicagoboys.html" class="inline">"The Chicago Boys in Chile: Economic Freedom's Awful Toll,"</a> <i>The Nation</i>, August 28, 1976\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f
857	The Caffeinated Modernizing El Salvador	1876	1916	els1	economy	EL Salvador: The Face of the Revolution by Robert Armstrong and Janet Shenk	<p class="columns">The history of modern El Salvador begins in a cup of\r\ncoffee. A new elite of exporters and bankers were determined\r\nto make their country the coffee center of Central America,\r\nand with the election of one of their own, President Zaldivar,\r\nin 1876, they began in earnest. On the grounds that neither\r\nthe Indian communities nor the country's municipalities were\r\nmaking efﬁcient use of their common lands, the would-be\r\ncoffee magnates pressured the government to eliminate all\r\nforms of landholding that were not in private hands. The\r\ngovernor of San Vicente province wrote in 1879: “The majority of these farmers do not wish to change their way of\r\nlife or to make progress because of the deep-rooted customs,\r\ntheir lack of ﬁnancial resources and their ignorance about\r\nthe great advantages of coffee cultivation.”\r\n<br>\r\nShortly thereafter, in 1881, the government simply decreed that the common lands, which had endured throughout the colonial period and after, would be no more. It passed legislation to control and recruit the dispossessed for work on the coffee ﬁncas, appointed agricultural judges who kept lists of day workers on the estates, and ordered their capture if they left before they completed their duties.\r\n<br>\r\nNew laws permitted landowners to evict squatters, forcing them to rent or wander landless. On most estates the landlords kept a few workers—<i>colonos</i>—to tend the farms between harvests, sometimes for pay, sometimes for room\r\nand board.\r\n<br>\r\nBut so radical a change in so short a time risked upheaval. Campesino revolts broke out in 1880, 1885, and 1898.\r\nTo ensure their control the coffee barons urged the build-up of the army. In 1900 a military training school was\r\nopened. In 1912 the government created a special security force exclusively to maintain order and to enforce the landlord's law in the rural areas, the <i>Guardia Nacional </i>(National\r\nGuard).\r\n<br>\r\nWith the dawn of the new century, the communal lands\r\nwere but a memory and the Guard-imposed peace reigned\r\nthroughout the land. A public relations tract on El Salvador\r\nin 1916 proclaimed:<br>\r\n<i>\r\nOne of the great obstacles that our agriculture was\r\nconfronted with was the deplorable system under\r\nwhich the national land was divided into </i>ejidos<i> and\r\n</i>tierras comunales<i> [communal lands], which caused\r\nland and labour to remain unused . . . . now the\r\nlandscape presents to the traveller a scene similar\r\nto a vast chessboard where the various products of\r\nthe fertile land may be admired; from the highest\r\npeaks to the beautiful valleys and plains, Salvador\r\npresents a view that reminds us of a large and well-\r\nkept garden, with every available piece of land being\r\nunder cultivation.</i>\r\n<br>\r\nSixty years later, here are a few facts about life in the "large and well-kept gardens":<br>\r\n<i>Two percent of the population controls 60 percent of the land; In 1975, 58 percent of the population earned $10/month or less; 70 percent of the children under five years of age are malnourished; The per capita calorie consumption rate is the lowest in the western hemisphere.

Nor is it credible that any one should possess so little understanding as to desire the faith and yet be destitute of the most necessary faculty to enable him to receive it. Hence Christ, who is the Truth itself, that has never failed and can never fail, said to the preachers of the faith whom He chose for that office 'Go ye and teach all nations.' He said all, without exception, for all are capable of receiving the doctrines of the faith.\r\n<br>\r\nThe enemy of the human race, who opposes all good deeds in order to bring men to destruction, beholding and envying this, invented a means never before heard of, by which he might hinder the preaching of God's word of Salvation to the people: he inspired his satellites who, to please him, have not hesitated to publish abroad that the Indians of the West and the South, and other people of whom We have recent knowledge should be treated as dumb brutes created for our service, pretending that they are incapable of receiving the Catholic Faith.\r\n<br>\r\nWe, who, though unworthy, exercise on earth the power of our Lord and seek with all our might to bring those sheep of His flock who are outside into the fold committed to our charge, consider, however, that the Indians are truly men and that they are not only capable of understanding the Catholic Faith but, according to our information, they desire exceedingly to receive it. Desiring to provide ample remedy for these evils, We define and declare by these Our letters, or by any translation thereof signed by any notary public and sealed with the seal of any ecclesiastical dignitary, to which the same credit shall be given as to the originals, that, notwithstanding whatever may have been or may be said to the contrary, the said Indians and all other people who may later be discovered by Christians, are by no means to be deprived of their liberty or the possession of their property, even though they be outside the faith of Jesus Christ; and that they may and should, freely and legitimately, enjoy their liberty and the possession of their property; nor should they be in any way enslaved; should the contrary happen, it shall be null and have no effect.\r\n<br>\r\nBy virtue of Our apostolic authority We define and declare by these present letters, or by any translation thereof signed by any notary public and sealed with the seal of any ecclesiastical dignitary, which shall thus command the same obedience as the originals, that the said Indians and other peoples should be converted to the faith of Jesus Christ by preaching the word of God and by the example of good and holy living.\r\n<br>\r\n[<i>Sublimus Dei</i> Dated: May 29, 1537]</p>	large	f

He seems to have been literate. Bored with life in Santo Domingo, he set off with Diego de Nicuesa for the South American mainland. He was shipwrecked. Saved from being fattened and eaten, he and Jerónimo de Aguilar, who later became Cortés's interpreter, settled down in Yucatán. Guerrero found a Mayan girl, by whom he had several children. He was a slave, but all the same, he became a military adviser to Na Chan Can, the cacique in Chetumal. Fray Diego Landa thought that he taught the Indians "how to fight, showing them how to build fortresses and bastions." \r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuerrero was said to have advised the Maya to attack Hernández de Córdoba in 1517. In 1519, he had refused to return to Spanish life, as Jerónimo de Aguilar did, saying to him, "Brother Aguilar, I am married and have three children, the Indians treat me as a chief and as a captain in war. You go [back] and God be with you but I already have my face tattooed and my ears pierced.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/gonzaloguerrero.jpg" class="floatleft">\r\n\r\nWhat would the Spaniards say if they saw me in this guise?

Never read by its intended recipient, the letter was essentially forgotten until unearthed in 1908 in a\r\nDanish archive.\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Your Majesty, in your great goodness you have always charged your\r\nviceroys and prelates, when they came to Peru, to look after our Indians\r\nand show favor to them, but once they disembark from their ships\r\nand set foot on land, they forget your commands and tum against us.\r\nOur ancient idolatry and heresy was due only to our ignorance of the\r\ntrue path.

It is unique for its over 300 drawings  and for its provincial's-eye viewpoint. Guaman Poma retells the lore of his "Yarovilca Allauca Huanuco" ancestors as well as giving an exceptionally full Inka history notable for its coverage of Inka 'queens' (coyas) and 'princesses' (nustas). He did not live to see his work read much. He was considered an eccentric and troublemaker in his own time, and when, in impoverished old age, he brought his New Chronicle and Good Government of Peru (probably finished in 1613 or 1615) to Lima, no Spanish official endorsed it. It gathered dust unread until 1908, when Richard Pietschmann found it in the Royal Library of Copenhagen.\r\n<br>\r\n<span class="bigquote" style="font-size:1em;">The Spaniards' insatiable appetite for precious metals baffled the Inka, who regarded cloth as a more valuable commodity.

This was the same year in which the Spanish king repealed all the laws protecting the Indians which had been passed only four years before through the work of Bartholomeo de las Casas, and the year in which Yucatan was finally conquered. In Yucatan, Landa lived many years building churches and monasteries, preaching, converting and became one of the first Franciscans to live among the Mayas, learning to speak their language and taking extensive notes about their culture. He was elected head of the Franciscan Order in Yucatan and then, in 1562, launched an elaborate inquisition in the town of Mani, torturing thousands and killing more than one hundred in an effort to get them to confess to human sacrifice and other sins. Convinced that the Mayan spiritual traditions were the work of the devil,<b> in July 1562, Landa burned eight centuries of ancient Mayan literature</b>: five thousand native religious images and at least twenty-seven painted books filled with hieroglyph-like images relating to their traditional religious practices and beliefs. Only four pre-Columbian codices, containing rare examples of Mayan writing, survived.\r\n<br>\r\nBishop Francisco de Toral finally stopped Landa's inquisition and sent him back to Spain, where, in 1564, he was tried for his excesses. He was eventually absolved of any misdeeds.\r\n<br>\r\nAs he waited for his case to be resolved, Landa wrote <i>Relacion de las Cosas de Yucatan</i>, now considered an authority on Mayan customs and language. The book would not be published for another three hundred years, but in the 20th century, Landa's work provided a valuable record and important clues for modern day scholars trying to decipher Mayan writing.\r\n<bt>\r\nAfter Toral's death, Landa was sent back to the New World in 1573 and was ordained Bishop of the Yucatan, a position he held until his death at age 54.</p>\r\n<p class="caption"><i>left</i>, Mural by Fernando Castro Pacheco: The Spanish bishop Diego de Landa burning figures of Mayan deities.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>	large	f
863	Closing a Distance	1874	1874	bra2	power	Born in blood and fire: a concise history of Latin America by John Charles Chasteen	<p class ="entry columns3">\r\nThe transportation revolution in Latin America meant, above all, steamships and railroads. Wooden sailing ships were at the mercy of fickle winds, and they carried less cargo than the iron-hulled steamships that gradually replaced them. Steamers plowed the waves faster and more reliably than did sailing ships. Steam-powered trains would eventually transform overland transportation, which had relied principally on pack mules or oxcarts. In general, mules and carts limited profitable export agriculture to the coastal plains. Railroads cost a lot to build, but once built, opened access to enormous areas, creating agricultural boomlets in practically every locality along the length of their tracks. As if steam were not enough, telegraph lines, able to transmit written messages instantaneously, introduced another nineteenth-century technological wonder—electricity. Stringing wires was easier than laying rails, blasting tunnels, and erecting bridges, so telegraph lines often outran train tracks. By 1874 a transatlantic telegraph cable had already been laid across the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean connecting Brazil to Europe.\r\n<br>\r\nNew technology transformed Latin America’s hazardous, unpredictable, and expensive communications with the rest of the world. That world would soon come to call, and elite Latin Americans, for whom Europe remained a cultural beacon, began to feel nervous at the prospect. After all, the “decent people” claimed social priority because of their European race and culture. But how would they measure up in the presence of the real thing? Would Europeans smirk at the “decent people’s” attempts to imitate them? Would they find Latin American countries devoid of <i>Progress</i>?\r\n<br>\r\nProgress (with a capital P) was the great theme of the West in the nineteenth century. The industrial and transportation revolutions had massively reordered societies and touched everyone’s lives in one way or another. Even when people suffered as a result, they stood in awe of the change. Somehow, the idea of inevitable, all-conquering technological advancement—a notion still with us today—had already taken hold of people’s imaginations. Here was a new hegemonic idea to replace the old colonial version. In a world where Progress seemed unstoppable, well-informed elite Latin Americans wanted to be part of it. Like other ruling classes in the West, they worried about modern materialism eroding traditional values, but they embraced materialism anyway. Exporting some thing for pounds sterling or dollars or francs was the obvious way to satisfy their desire to be up-to-date in European terms.\r\nExport earnings, after all, could buy fence wire and sewing machines and steam engines. In other words, export earnings\r\ncould literally import Progress, or so the elite believed.\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mid-1800s, Progress was becoming a sort of secular religion, and liberals were its prophets. Back in 1810, their vision of progress had a political emphasis: republics, constitutions, elections. As it turned out, that kind of progress bogged down in a morass of conflicting interests.\r\n<br>\r\nTechnological progress, on the other hand, still had an invincible reputation, and Latin American liberals reaped the benefits of the idea’s awesome persuasiveness. The years 1850—1875 saw a political sea change all across Latin America as the inevitability of Progress became simple common sense for the educated elite. People continued to follow caudillos and patrons. Economic interests still collided. But everywhere in Latin America, the liberals gained advantage by riding the wave of the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="caption"><i>Background</i>, a section of transatlantic cable.</p>\r\n\r\n	large	f
865	Benito Juarez and his Law	1855	1858	mex22	event	Born in blood and fire: a concise history of Latin America by John Charles Chasteen	<div class="page" data-title="Benito Juarez"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">When Mexican liberals began their great mid-century uprising—the beginning of an entire period called the Reform—the president was once again the old caudillo Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, who had worked overall to keep things from changing for a generation. Santa Anna finally left for exile in 1855. If Santa Anna represents Mexican politics as usual in the early post independence era, the liberals who gathered against him represent an alternative Mexico. At their head was Juan Alvarez, a tough mestizo caudillo from the tangled mountains of indigenous southern Mexico. Alvarez had been a patriot since the 1810s, when Santa Anna was still a royalist. Now an old man, and not much of a politician, Alvarez became the figurehead president after the departure of Santa Anna. But the real liberal crusaders of mid-century were younger men, educated men of words and laws. One was Melchor Ocampo. Like Alvarez, Ocampo was a mestizo, a man of humble background but extraordinary talent—an amateur scientist, economist, linguist, dramatist, and professional lawyer. Ocampo exemplifies a particular kind of liberal leadership—young, urban, mestizo, upwardly mobile men for whom progress offered personal advancement. Benito Juarez, the first person of fully indigenous ancestry to become governor of a Mexican state, likewise provides an atypical, but highly symbolic, example.\r\n<br>\r\nJuarez, like Ocampo, was an orphan with nowhere to go in life but up. At the age of twelve, he tired of watching over his uncle’s sheep in the mountains, left his Zapotec village, and traveled to the provincial city of Oaxaca, where his sister worked as a cook. There he put on European clothes (becoming famous, in fact, for the relentless formality of his black frock coat), perfected his Spanish, and eventually studied law at Oaxaca’s new public Institute of Arts and Sciences, which existed thanks to Mexico’s post independence liberal government. Juarez then practiced law in Oaxaca, at one point representing poor villagers against a supposedly abusive priest, a case that landed Juarez in jail for a few days. Eventually, he was elected to the state legislature and national congress and served five years as governor of Oaxaca. But Juarez left his Zapotec identity behind when he donned his black frock coat. He did not represent the interests of the Zapotecs in particular, or of indigenous people as a group. To call him an indio was to insult him, and he sometimes used rice powder to lighten his dark complexion. Yet everyone in Oaxaca—and, one day, all Mexicans—knew where Benito Juárez came from. His enemies might call him “a monkey dressed up as Napoleon,” but to many Mexicans, the personal rise of Benito Juarez confirmed the promise of liberalism.\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Law"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns3">\r\n\r\n Among the first decrees of the liberal Reform was the Juarez Law (1855), which attacked military and ecclesiastical fueros and thrust its author into the national limelight. A couple of months later, the liberals decreed the Lerdo Law (1856), abolishing collective landholding. The Lerdo Law struck primarily at the church, which would now have to sell off its vast properties, but its secondary effect was to jeopardize the communal lands of indigenous villages. The Reform credo enshrined individual effort, property, and responsibility. According to the liberals, distributing village lands to individual families as private property would motivate each family to work harder because of the selfishness inherent in human nature. But indigenous villagers had their own vision,and they believed that communal lands benefited them. For that reason some indigenous villagers joined the “decent people” and other conservatives under the banner of “Religion and Fueros” and opposed the liberal Reform of the 1850s. \r\n<br>\r\nThe Reform lasted for only a few years before a conservative general seized the presidency and dissolved Congress in 1858. A full-scale civil war then erupted. Fleeing toward the liberal strongholds in the mestizo mining towns of the Mexican north, the reformers chose Benito Juárez to command their forces. They chose well, because even those who disliked Juárez respected his determination. The conservatives controlled most of the army, but the liberals now enjoyed widespread popular support. The Juarez government soon retook Mexico City, but the liberals’ troubles were not over. The civil war had bankrupted the Mexican state, and Juarez suspended payment on foreign debt. France, Spain, and Britain retaliated by collectively occupying Veracruz. At first, this occupation seemed simply another episode of gunboat diplomacy. The French, however, had an ulterior motive.\r\n<br>\r\n In desperation, defeated Mexican conservatives reached for their secret weapon: a monarch. Napoleon III of France wanted to expand French influence in Latin America.In fact, the French invented the name “Latin America” during these years as a way of making their influence seem natural. Before the mid-1800s, people had talked of Mexico or Brazil or Argentina, and also of “America,” but never of “Latin America.” Because French, like Spanish and Portuguese, is directly descended from Latin, the term “Latin America” implied a cultural kinship with France. Napoleon III obligingly supplied Mexican conservatives with a potential monarch obedient to French interests. The would-be emperor of Mexico, Maximilian, was a truly well-intentioned man from one of Europe’s greatest royal dynasties, the Hapsburgs. Before accepting the plan, Maximilian asked earnestly whether the Mexican peopie really wanted an emperor. Mexican conservatives falsely assured him that they did.</p>	large	t
866	Guano boom in Peru	1840	1849	per1	economy		<p class="entries columns" style="background-color: rgba(255,255,255,.5);">\r\nFormerly the mighty center of Spanish-speaking South America, its very name synonymous with silver, Peru had suffered a series of turbulent military caudillos in the wake of independence. But already in the 1840s, a new export product rescued Peruvian fortunes or, more precisely, the fortunes of the “decent people” of Lima. This product was <i>guano</i>, the old fertilizer from Inca days, seabird manure, that had accumulated for thousands of years on offshore islands, <i>pictured</i>,  where the birds nested. Easy—if not exactly pleasant—to mine, guano deposits stood in great mounds, waiting to be shoveled aboard ship, and European farmers could not get enough of the nitrogen-rich fertilizer. Guano export required substantial capital for ships, crews, installations, and shovel men, but British capitalists saw it as a safe investment. British guano exporters operated offshore, even bringing workers from China to keep the process totally under outside control. The Peruvian government, for its part, got a direct cut of the profits, usually more than half, because the guano islands were government property. As Peruvian export earnings doubled and doubled again, the formerly poverty-stricken national government had a bonanza on its hands.\r\n<br>\r\nGuano money immediately began to build one of Latin America’s first railroads. Lima got public gas lighting and other urban improvements, not to mention public jobs for the “decent people,” a kind of export-driven growth that became common in Latin America as a whole only half a century later. But now (or later), little of this prosperity reached the other Peru—the sierra, the Andean highlands that rise sharply behind Lima and the narrow coastal plain. Since the Peruvian government no longer depended on Andean silver or on the head tax paid by indigenous people of the sierra, it could afford to neglect that region. This, too, was a portent of the\r\nfuture.\r\n<i>Born in Blood and Fire by John Charles Chasteen</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entries columns3" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;position:relative;left:250px;top:-10px;width:800px;">\r\n\r\nIn the period between the Independence Wars (1820-1824) and the War of the Paciﬁc (1879-1883), the colonial legacy of hierarchy and division foreclosed a shared sense of Peruvian national identity. A tiny minority of European descent controlled land, power, and capital. The lower and bottom tiers of society were filled by the brown majorities. To be sure, neither the elite nor the underclasses were monolithic. Black slaves in lca's vineyards and orchards were descendants of West Africans brought in chains to Peru in the seventeenth century. Chinese laborers were indentured in the 1850s to dig guano from the rocky islands of\r\nParacas to ship as fertilizer to Europe. German colonists arrived at the century's close in the coffee-growing jungles of the Chanchamayo valley. Astute visitors, like French feminist Flora Tristan, understood that republican Peru was crosscut by differences along lines of political and religious conviction, gender, and ethnicity. In general, however, the society pivoted on the privilege of the wealthy and the European over the poor and  “uncivilized" races.The sharp-tongued nineteenth-century critic Manuel Gonzalez Prada compared the treatment of Peru's Indian majorities to that received by serfs under the boot of feudal lords.\r\n<br>\r\nInstability prevailed after independence. At least twenty-four regime changes erupted between 1825 and 1841, as ﬁerce disputes raged between rival warlords, or <i>caudillos</i>. From the late 1840s to the early 1870s, the Age of Guano brought a precarious consolidation. Exports of the bird dung from coastal islands reached more than $20 million a year by the mid-1850s, tightening Peru’s links to the world economy. Especially strong was the connection to the main imperial power of the age, Great Britain. Peru of the nineteenth century was marked by the arrival of a stream of British as well as French, Italian, and German travelers, officials, and investors. Foreign businessmen partnered the coastal oligarchy in Andean mines, railroads, and cotton and sugar plantations, as the cheap labor of blacks, Chinese, and Indians generated the enormous profits that filled the coffers of British and German companies and bankrolled the magnificent estates and European excursions of the creole elite.\r\n<br>\r\nThe Independence Wars were waged under the Enlightenment principles of equality of rights and economic man. Yet old colonial prejudices intersected with new “scientific” doctrines of racial “types” and hierarchies. Not all of these classifications were as virulent as that of the Lima intellectual who in 1891 decried the Andean Indians as “a degenerated, old branch of the ethnic trunk from which all inferior races emerged . . . with almost no mental life, apathetic, without aspirations.“ Plenty of Peruvians found their own means to challenge the regnant order, whether in sly jokes or angry revolts. Yet interlocking hierarchies of class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and color retained a persuasive power, the ideological foundations of a country where the denial of political representation and economic rights to the majorities reflected their effective exclusion from the “imagined community” of national citizenry. The depth of division was laid bare by the War of the Paciﬁc. Although guano deposits were a bonanza in the 1850s and 1860s, they were almost exhausted even before the conflict, and the mismanaged government went bankrupt in 1874.\r\n<i>The Peru Reader (DUKE)</i>\r\n</p>	large	f

103	Curaçao Revolt	1795	1795	cur1	redfist	<i>Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion</i> edited by Junius P. Rodriguez	<p class="entry columns" style="background:white;width:550px;">\r\nThe Dutch West Indies, which included Suriname and the “ABC islands” of Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, was frequently the site of organized slave resistance in the late eighteenth century. Due to the extent of the slave population and the limited number of colonial inhabitants in the region, rebellion had the potential for wreaking tremendous devastation upon the area.\r\n<br>\r\nOn August 17, 1795, slaves on the island of Curaçao in the Dutch West Indies launched an insurrection that lasted for one month before it was suppressed by colonial authorities. The rebellion was led by slaves named Tula Rigaud and Bastiaan Carpata. Up to 4000 Negro slaves on the Northwest section of the island revolted. Over a thousand of the slaves were involved in heavy gunfights and the Dutch feared for their lives. Colonial officials eventually used a force of free black militia to put down the insurrection.\r\n<br>\r\nIt is likely that inspiration for the rebellion in Curaçao apparently came from two independent outside sources. Slaves on the island were aware of the success that slave rebels in the French colony of Saint Domingue had experienced in their efforts to win freedom through the force of arms. In addition, news had reached Curaçao about the defeat of the Dutch by French revolutionary forces in Europe and the subsequent establishment of the Batavian Republic (1795). Rumors circulated on the island of Curaçao\r\nthat the Batavian Republic would initiate reforms akin to those that had been adopted by the French in their Constitution of 1794, reforms that would likely abolish slavery throughout the Dutch West Indies.\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dutch moved colonial troops from Suriname to Curaçao in order to suppress the revolt, and these included the Corps of Free Coloreds and Blacks. The black troops were especially employed to root out maroon settlements on the island of Curaçao that were suspected of being somehow complicit with the actions of the slave rebels.\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Tula and Carpata were tortured on the rack before they were put to death and made to confess the false charge that their true intention had been to kill all of the whites on the island. In the aftermath of the revolt, Dutch authorities made efforts to alleviate some of the harsher labor practices (e.g., working on Sundays) that had been contributing factors in causing unrest on Curaçao.\r\n</p>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/curacao.jpg" style="position:absolute;left:585px;top:40px;width:600px;">\r\n\r\n<!--  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cura%C3%A7ao1836.png -->	large	t

763	"And What Does One Do With a Rabid Dog?"	1985	1985	inpan2	massacre	Overthrow by Stephen Kinzer and ATinyRevolution blog	<p class="entry columns3">\r\n<strong>Sept. 13, 1985 </strong><i>Beheaded body of Hugo Spadafora found near Costa Rican-Panama border.  </i>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/HugoSpadafora-small.jpg" class="floatleft">\r\n&emsp;The murder of Hugo Spadafora, one of the most flamboyant figures\r\nin modern Panamanian history, stunned a country where such crimes\r\nare all but unknown. Revulsion rose to a new level when the results of\r\nan autopsy on Spadafora's torso were released, showing that he had suffered\r\nthrough hours of unspeakable torture and that his head had been\r\nslowly severed while he was still alive. These facts alone, however, were\r\nhardly enough to rouse the United States into action. During the mid-\r\n1980s, senior American leaders, including President Ronald Reagan,\r\nvigorously supported military regimes in Guatemala and El Salvador,\r\nwhose troops carried out comparable crimes every day. What made the\r\nSpadafora murder such a crucial turning point in Panamanian history\r\nwas that it signaled the regime's slide into irrationality. That is a quality\r\nthe United States can tolerate in many of its allies but not one whose\r\ndomain is so close to the Panama Canal.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Noriega was at a dermatology clinic in Geneva when Spadafora was\r\nkilled, undergoing treatment that he hoped would repair his deeply\r\nscarred face. There he received an urgent telephone call from Major Luis\r\nCordoba, head of the unit that had captured Spadafora. Evidently neither\r\nman realized that American intelligence agents were eavesdropping.\r\n"We have the rabid dog in our hands," Major Cordoba told his\r\ncommander.<br>\r\n&emsp;"And what does one do with a rabid dog?" Noriega asked in reply.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;That was the go-ahead soldiers needed in order to begin the long night\r\nof torture that ended in Spadafora's decapitation.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;A year earlier, Noriega had directed an electoral fraud from which\r\nNicolas Ardito Barletta, a brilliant but colorless Chicago-trained economist,\r\nhad emerged as president of Panama. Now he demanded that Barletta\r\npublicly absolve him of involvement in the Spadafora murder.\r\nBarletta refused, and on September 27,1985, two weeks after the murder,\r\nNoriega forced him to resign. He left office with a prophetic warning.\r\n"Listen to me," Barletta told Noriega. "The day will come when you\r\nare sorry for what you are doing. Remember my words."\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;During this period, Noriega further endeared himself to the Reagan\r\nadministration by agreeing to help the Nicaraguan contras. While publicly\r\nmouthing platitudes about the need for peace and cooperation\r\namong Central American countries, he gave the contras invaluable\r\ncovert support. He welcomed their leaders in Panama, permitted the\r\nUnited States to train their fighters in secret at Panamanian bases, and\r\nturned a blind eye when the Americans began using Howard Air Force\r\nBase, in the Canal Zone, for clandestine flights carrying weapons to\r\ntheir bases along the Nicaragua-Honduras border.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;After Noriega forced President Barletta out of office, the American\r\nambassador in Panama, Everett Briggs, wanted to begin increasing\r\nAmerican pressure on him. His boss, Undersecretary of State Elliott\r\nAbrams, a vigorous supporter of the contras, overruled him. Two months\r\nlater, eager to learn firsthand what the United States thought of him,\r\nNoriega traveled to Washington to meet the CIA director, William\r\nCasey. Casey had been the chief architect of the contra project, and\r\nrather than reprimand Noriega or demand that he change his behavior,\r\nhe was downright friendly.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/noriegaangry-small.jpg" class="floatright">\r\n&emsp;At the end of 1985, the newly appointed national security adviser,\r\nAdmiral John Poindexter, came to Panama to meet with Noriega, and\r\nalthough according to some reports he was tougher than Casey had been,\r\nhe was not forceful enough to impress his host. The Reagan administration\r\nwas so obsessed with the idea of overthrowing the Sandinistas that\r\nit was ready to support even a scoundrel like Noriega as long as he continued\r\nto help the contras.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;As this became clear to Panamanian opposition figures, they began\r\nlooking for other ways to influence American policy. One of them, Winston\r\nSpadafora, a brother of the murdered dissident, flew to Washington\r\nand managed to persuade Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina,\r\nchairman of the Senate subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs,\r\nto hold hearings on Panama in the spring of 1986. A week before the\r\nfirst scheduled hearing, Abrams called Helms and asked him to cancel\r\nit. He said that Noriega was "being really helpful to us" and was "really\r\nnot that big a problem."</p>	large	f
346	"<i>In this long war, with the camera<br> as our rifle, we do in fact move into a guerrilla activity.</i>"	1967	1973	arg22	culture		<p class="entry columns3">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1969, Fernando Ezequiel Solanas (b. Buenos Aires, 1936), in collaboration with other Argentine filmmakers, filmed a chapter of Argentina, mayo de 1969: los caminos de la liberación. The film has never been restored in its entirety, and few have seen it. Nevertheless, it remains a legendary testimony to collective political unrest, particularly influential for its promotion of cinema as a new vehicle of protest against a ruling regime.\r\nSolanas’ filmic inspirations were not exclusively cinematic: his earlier studies in literature, music, dance and law led him to pursue theater arts at the Conservatory of Dramatic Arts (Conservatorio de Arte Dramático), where cinema would eventually seduce him. His career in cinema began at age 26, with the filming of Seguir andando (1962). Another short film, Reflexión ciudadana (1963), followed a year later. \r\nLike his friend Octavio Getino, Solanas was a Peronist, and in 1968 the two men directed the most influential political documentary of the era: La hora de los hornos: Notas y testimonios sobre el neocolonialismo, la violencia y la liberación. Divided into three parts, the 255-minute documentary managed to be many things at once: instrument of leftist political and social protest; manifesto; educational cinematic debate; essay of cultural interpretation of Latin America in general and of Argentina in particular; a filmic collage, collecting and juxtaposing fragments from other films of the period; active artifact in the democratization of images; unofficial history. It was also the most controversial film of the 1960s.  \r\n<br>\r\nSolanas and Getino also founded the Grupo Cine Liberación and developed the theory of “Third Cinema”: a cinema that is neither commercial nor authorial, emerging instead from the public at large. Meanwhile, the two kept in close contact with Juan Domingo Perón during his exile in Madrid (1955-1974), following his removal from power in the so-called Liberating Revolution (Revolución Libertadora). The relationship resulted in their 1971 film, Perón: Actualización política y doctrinaria para la toma del poder. \r\n<br>\r\nSolanas’ second full-length film, Los hijos de Fierro (1972), appropriated a well-known literary character in order to experiment with combining scenes of fiction and documentary. This innovation achieves an extremely personal reading of Martín Fierro, the classic “gauchesco” poem of 1872. Adding to the film’s unique ambition, much of the dialogue is written in the same octosyllabic meter as José Hernández’s poem. Given the poem’s fundamental role in Argentine culture, it becomes a poignant frame of reference and brilliant backdrop for a complex film that oscillates between epic and lyric, realist and mythic, allowing the poem’s “characters” and scenarios to articulate a political allegory of the 1970s in Argentina.  \r\nIn 1975, the military executed another coup d’etat in Argentina. The following year, Solanas went into exile. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<font style="display:none">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrupo Cine Liberacion, Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino, Cine Base Formed (1973), letters from Peron</font></p>	large	t

651	The Harkin Amendment	1975	1975	usa1	power	Washington, Somoza, and the Sandinistas: State and Regime in U.S. Policy Toward Nicaragua, 1969-1981	<p class="entry columns3"><strong><i>The Harkin Amendment states foreign assistance won't be sent to governments with gross human rights violations.</i></strong><br>\r\n&emsp;During the final year of the Ford presidency, Nicaragua became one target of a growing U.S. Congressional focus on human rights abuses in the Third World, particularly by governments receiving American economic and military aid. The White House refusal to comply with non-binding legislation calling for the termination of military assistance programs to repressive allies failed to slow down the groundswell of legislative support for sanctions against offending regimes. Subsequently, Congress passed the Harkin amendment, legally mandating the executive branch to halt all economic aid to governments deemed guilty of a gross and consistent pattern of human rights violations. In May 1976, the amendment was extended to U.S. policy in the Inter-American Development Bank and the African Development Bank. U.S. representatives in these regional economic institutions were now required to vote against loan requests from designated human rights abusers except where the monies were intended to "directly benefit the poor." Congress also directed the Secretary of State to submit an annual report on the status of human rights in all countries receiving\r\nU.S. aid. Finally, legislative pressure was instrumental in the administration's decision to establish a human rights office in the State Department.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIrrespective of these Congressional demands for greater attention to human rights questions in the conduct of foreign policy, the overall Ford White House posture remained a mixture of reluctant accommodation, subtle resistance, and outright rejection. The major stumbling block was Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who exhibited a palpable lack of enthusiasm over the idea that morality had any, let alone a prominent, role to play in the making of foreign policy - and a President willing to defer to his Secretary's judgment on this issue. A senior Inter-American Affairs official summarized the basic approach:\r\n<span class="blockquote"><i>Ford policy remained essentially the Kissinger policy which basically placed considerably less emphasis on human rights issues and more on government stability and friendly relations. Governments supportive of the United States were basically viewed as good governments. The policy of the Kissinger period was to do what was necessary to satisfy\r\nCongress on human rights but not to take any measures to distance the U.S. from governments helpful to us.</i></span>\r\n&emsp;\r\nNeither the Harkin amendment nor the newly formed State Department's Office of Human Rights substantially interfered with this general policy line. In the multilateral development banks, the administration applied pressure to force postponements of final decisions on loan submissions from repressive Third World allies. "Our general tactic," an involved official observed, "was to get loan requests put off so we didn't have to vote either way." Meanwhile, Kissinger ensured that the Office of Human Rights was kept outside of the policymaking "loop." According to the Office's first coordinator James Morrison Wilson, he routinely ignored Office memorandums recommending greater attention to human rights factors in America's relations with autocratic governments. As a result, it wielded virtually no influence over Third World aid decisions.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nNot surprisingly, the Secretary was harshly critical of any subordinates who publicly diverged from his approach. In June 1976, for instance, Kissinger "laid out the administration's line" on human rights in an opening address to the Organization of American States which was meeting to consider the issue. In the debate that followed, comments by U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador Robert White "went a considerable way to specifically condemn Somoza and the Chilean dictator Pinochet." Kissinger was "outraged" and accused White of having "overstepped his instructions."</p>	large	f

In late 1917 the Immigration Service began requiring passports of all who wanted to cross from the United States into Mexico to limit the ability of individuals who were in the service of enemy governments to communicate with those governments. Such war-related hysteria, combined with the campaigning of\r\nthe growing reformist movement against the “vices” of Tijuana and the instability brought about by the Mexican Revolution, led to an official closing of the boundary by U.S. authorities in December 1917, a closing that remained in effect for two years. That\r\nsaid, even during the war, the ability of U.S. authorities to patrol the boundary was very limited. As of February 1918, for example, there were five immigration inspectors stationed in Calexico, one in Campo, and four in Tia Juana. As the Supervising Inspector\r\nof the Mexican Border District wrote at the time, the inspectors, given the myriad demands on their time, “are able to give but little attention to patrol duty.” And despite the nominal stationing of U.S. troops along the boundary at the time, it appears that their\r\nnumbers were very much insufficient. As the supervising inspector wrote about enforcement measures along the U.S.-Mexico boundary in general, “so long as the border is not adequately guarded, the restrictive measures employed at ports of entry simply tend to divert the illegal traffic to unguarded points, of which there are literally thousands.”\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n	large	f

718	Noriega is named Commander of newly created Panamanian Defense Forces.	1983	1984	pan1	power	Rogue State by William Blum	<p class="entry columns" style="padding:9px;background-color:white;width:608px;"><strong>1983</strong> General Noriega is named Commander of newly created Panamanian Defense Forces.\r\n<br> &emsp;He had twice attended the U.S. Army School of the Americas in the Panama Canal Zone and had been on the CIA payroll since the 1960s, despite knowledge by US drug authorities as early as 1971 that the general was heavily involved in drug trafficking and money laundering.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Corrupt and unscrupulous, he profited from assisting Colombia's Medellin drug cartel, hut he also fingered Medellin rivals to the\r\nU.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. His assistance to the contras in Nicaragua won him protection from top Reagan\r\nadministration officials, including William Casey, Elliott Abrams, and Oliver North. US officials, including CIA Director William Webster and several Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) officers, sent Noriega letters of praise for his efforts to thwart drug trafficking (albeit only against competitors of his Medellin Cartel patrons). \r\n<br>&emsp;In 1984, the CIA helped finance a highly questionable presidential electoral victory for one of Manuel Noriega's men. Because of a controversy in 1984—when NED funds were used to aid a Panamanian presidential candidate backed by Manuel Noriega and the CIA—Congress enacted a law prohibiting the use of NED funds "to finance the campaigns of candidates for public office."\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n<strong>So about that election....</strong><br>\r\n&emsp;In some cases. the State Department's National Endowment of Democracy has been instrumental in helping ease the transfer of power from military to civilian rule, but it has not consistently resisted military rule. In 1984. it funded the military-backed presidential candidate in Panama. Nicolás Ardito Barletta, a University of Chicago economics graduate who previously held no political office and who was widely regarded as a puppet of Panamanian strongman General Manuel Noriega, himself a U.S. ally at the time.<br>\r\n&emsp;Even without direct political experience, Barletta had other U.S.-approved credentials and sources of support. Before returning to Panama thaI year, he had been a vice president of the World Bank for six years. To help him in his electoral ambitions, the U.S. firm D. H. Sawyer and Associates supplied the word power (the theme of "new leadership") and other campaign expertise–what one writer called another example of "the age-old dream of exporting American democracy to the world." Sawyer's contact with\r\nBarletta had been arranged by Jimmy Carter's chief of staff, Hamilton Jordan.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Richard Dresner, who in the 1990s worked to get Boris Yeltsin elected in Russia, did Barletta's polling, even though he admitted knowing next to nothing about Panama. Census data on household television ownership and the addresses of voters were all that interested him. Dresner focused on TV ads and a direct-mail campaign. A former Israeli intelligence officer ran focus groups. The whole affair cost well beyond a million dollars, and Barletta won a narrow victory. but not without extensive vote count fraud\r\norganized by Noriega. Barletta was invited to the Reagan White House.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Why did the United States support a military-backed politician with so little political experience? In part, it was that Noriega, at the time a longtime CIA "asset," permitted Panama to be used as a training area for the Contras, the counterrevolutionary Nicaraguan exile group of the deposed Somoza dictatorship that the United States was supporting. Panama also trained Salvodoran\r\narmy officers to fight against the left-wing FMLN rebellion in that country. NED money was channeled in part to pro-Barletta unions through the AFL-CIO's Free Track Union Institute. NED's tactics succeeded–briefly.\r\nIn less than a year, Noriega forced Barletta out of office.\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Global Electioneering: Campaign Consulting, Communications, and Corporate Financing by Gerald Sussman</strong></p>	large	f

One of the main problems in gaining recognition for these alliances is the difficulty of incorporating Guatemala. The first attempt, in August 1979, was the so-called Iron Triangle of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala; it faltered at that time for the dearth of any democratic credentials. Next came the "Strategic Triangle," in which more palatable countries–Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic and Colombia–were to be enlisted as pincer states, where U.S. troops would come and go freely. As Congress lagged on allocating funds for upgraded airstrips in these countries, a new idea was born: that of the Central American Democratic Community. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe Central American Democratic Community consisting of\r\nHonduras, Costa Rica and El Salvador was created in January\r\n1982. Its creation was a US maneuver to legitimize the elections\r\nin El Salvador, grant recognition to the "elected" regime, co-ordinate\r\naction to stimulate development of the private sector in each\r\ncountry, and provide the framework for the creation of an interventionist\r\nforce in the Central American area. Colombia, the United\r\nStates and Guatemala later became members of the Community.\r\nThe intention was to establish a political and military wall to isolate revolutionary Nicaragua.\r\nAs part of this encirclement scheme, Washington planned\r\nto establish naval and air bases on the island of Amapala in\r\nthe Gulf of Fonseca and on San Andres island in the Caribbean,\r\nboth of them within the continental shelf of Nicaragua.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nBut the Democratic Community\r\nquickly became a two-edged contradiction in\r\nterms when the Administration urged the inclusion\r\nof Guatemala.\r\n<br>&emsp; With the Malvinas-Falklands war, U.S.\r\nhopes for rehabilitating Guatemala took a real\r\nnose dive.

259	United Fruit and The US Military Fight the Honduran Civil War	1924	1925	hon1	war	Inevitable Revolutions: The United States in Central America  By Walter LaFeber	<p class="entry columns" style="column-gap: 90px; -webkit-column-gap: 90px;"><span class="intro">U.S. Troops intervene in the Honduran Civil War, which has been provoked by the U.S.-owned United Fruit and Coyumel companies.</span>\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe small nations of Central America were dependent on one or two crops, and those crops were largely controlled by North American Investors.\r\nThe statistics are astounding: of Costa Rivas $18 million of exports in\r\n1929, $12 million came from coffee, $5 million from bananas. Of El\r\nSalvador's $18 million of exports, $17 million represented coffee and\r\nabout one million dollars, sugar. Of Guatemala's $25 million total exports, $19 million was in coffee and $3 million in bananas. Honduras\r\nexported $25 million worth of products; bananas accounted for $21\r\nmillion. Of Nicaragua's $11 million export trade, coffee represented $6\r\nmillion and bananas $2 million. Clearly if the prices of coffee and bananas suddenly dropped on international markets, all Central America\r\nwould plunge into disaster.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nMany U.S. investors would share in the disaster, for they had become\r\nparamount in Central America. Their direct investments in the area\r\nmore than doubled between 1919 and 1929 to $251 million. In Guatemala they (especially United Fruit) controlled all but a few miles of the\r\nrailroads, one-fifteenth of the total land area, the leading bank, a number\r\nof major industries, and the great utility company (American and Foreign Power owned by General Electric). In Honduras, United Fruit and\r\nits subsidiaries controlled the rail system, port facilities, and nearly all the banana and rubber-producing lands. North Americans owned the prosperous silver mine. In Nicaragua, United Fruit and Atlantic Fruit claimed 300,000 acres. North Americans owned and/or managed the leading mines, the railroads, the lumber industry, and banks. El Salvador's bonds were now handled by New York instead of British banks, its most important domestic financial institution was owned by San Francisco interests, and its transportation system depended on North American capital. U.S. investment had nearly caught up with British in Costa Rica, and the dominant company in the nation was unquestionably United Fruit. North Americans controlled railroads, mines, cables, and–thanks to Woodrow Wilson–oil concessions. Behind these dull statistics lay an economic empire of which few (aside, perhaps, from Minor Keith, whose power was matched only by his imagination) had dreamed a mere twenty years before. Always a genius in his timing, Keith died in 1929 just as disaster struck the system.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThis economic power was protected, and the politics of several of these small nations largely shaped, by the ever-present military forces of the United States. In Honduras, for example, U.S. troops had intervened six different times by 1925. At that point, North Americans were\r\nso dominant that they even fought each other. This embarrassment\r\noccurred after Tiburcio Carías Andino (later to be the most skillful of all\r\nHonduran dictators) lost a presidential election in 1923 that was obviously\r\nfixed by the incumbent Liberal party. Carías had taken care to win\r\nthe favor of United Fruit, and with the company's support launched a\r\nrevolt. The imaginative Carías even pioneered the use of aerial bombardment\r\nin Central America during the war. U.S. officials, however, had set\r\nthe ground rules for Honduras in 1911 and 1912, and the Washington\r\ntreaties of 1923 reaffirmed the rules. So U.S. troops landed in 1924 to\r\nprotect lives and property, and soon found themselves fighting against\r\nUnited Fruit's presidential nominee. When the conflict spread to areas\r\nwhere foreigners lived, the U.S. forces quickly smashed Carías's dreams\r\nof power. The 1923 treaties had been upheld. Sumner Welles then\r\nmediated, and a man acceptable to all sides became president. North\r\nAmerican power had become so encompassing that U.S. military forces\r\nand United Fruit could struggle against each other to see who was to\r\ncontrol the Honduran government, then have the argument settled by\r\nthe U.S. Department of State. But the story ended happily for Carías. In\r\n1929 United Fruit bought out Sam Zemurray's Cuyamel Fruit Company,\r\nand since Cuyamel had bought and paid for the Liberal party–Carías's\r\npolitical enemy–the Liberals suddenly found themselves without\r\nfunds. In 1932 Carías grabbed power over little opposition, and\r\nhand-in-hand with United Fruit ruled his country for the next seventeen\r\nyears.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAn ominous reaction to such displays of U.S. force soon appeared. At\r\nthe Havana Conference of 1928 the Latin American nations resolved\r\nthat "No state has a right to intervene in the internal affairs of another."\r\nThe U.S. delegates fought the resolution, but when they offered a weak\r\nsubstitute, only four of the twenty American states (including, of course,\r\nNicaragua) voted with them. The original, damning resolution was put\r\noff until the next inter-American meeting, but Laurence Duggan, a top\r\nState Department expert on Latin America, later wrote: "<i>It was one of\r\nthe worst diplomatic defeats ever suffered by the United States at an\r\nimportant international conference.</i>"	large	f

Roosevelt creates INS\r\n(Immigration and Naturalization Service)</font>\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAs immigration regulations become more complex, Roosevelt combines the\r\nimmigration and naturalization bureaus, creating the Immigration and\r\nNaturalization Service (INS). Over 365,000 people have been exiled from the\r\nUnited States since the start of the Great Depression, putting a strain on\r\nMexico's resources. The Mexican government establishes colonies in the\r\ntropical jungle region of southern Mexico, but they soon collapse after\r\ndozens die from hunger and disease in the first few weeks. The repatriation\r\ncampaign becomes harder to implement as Mexico begins to discourage\r\nrepatriation and even threatens to expel U.S. businesses from the country.\r\nMassive raids end and deportation trains decline, yet the INS remains\r\ncommitted to a policy of expulsion throughout the decade. At least 90,000\r\nmore people are sent to Mexico over the next four years. INS increases\r\nborder security and refuses re-admission to Mexicans who were repatriated.\r\nImmigration goes from 236,000 in 1929 to 23,000 in 1933.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/1933insstrike.jpg" class="floatright" style="width: 100%; padding-bottom: 9px;">\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe INS becomes involved in suppressing labor organizing throughout\r\nCalifornia. Crop prices improve in 1933 and farmers' gross income\r\nincreases, but their workers' wages hit their lowest point. Forty-eight\r\nthousand farm workers protest by waging the largest number of strikes in\r\nthe history of California agriculture. Farm bosses call for the expulsion\r\nof Mexicans from the country. Strike leaders are arrested and deported. INS\r\nagents poses as workers and persuades people to return to Mexico. Growers,\r\npolice, and INS used violence and deportation threats as strike-breaking\r\ntactics, collaborating with welfare agencies who withdraw assistance to\r\nforce strikers to accept unfair terms. The San Joaquin cotton strike alone\r\ninvolves ten to twelve thousand farm workers, over half of whom are Mexican\r\nAmericans and Mexican immigrants. 13 workers are shot and 3 killed (one of\r\nthem clubbed to death) by growers, who are acquitted of all charges.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nUp to 2 million Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants are exiled from\r\nthe U.S. during the repatriation campaign. It does not end until 1942 when\r\nthe government begins recruiting Mexicans to provide labor during WWII.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="caption"><i>Pictured,</i> Mexican workers protest farm bosses' use of violence to\r\nbreak the 1933 cotton strike.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<President Herbert Hoover merges the Bureau of Immigration and the Bureau of Naturalization to form the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).>	large	f

Ríos Montt was one in a long series of dictators who ran Guatemala after the Dulles brothers and United Fruit, backed by the CIA, decided that elected President Jacob Arbenz held the country &quot;in the grip of a Russian-controlled dictatorship&quot; and overthrew the country's constitutional democracy in 1954. The succession of corrupt military dictators ruled Guatemala for over 30 years, one anti-communist tyrant after another receiving U.S. support, aid, and training.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAfter the 1982 coup that brought Ríos Montt to power, U.S. Ambassador Frederic C. Chapin said Guatemala &quot;has come out of the darkness and into the light.&quot; President Reagan claimed Mont was given &quot;a bum rap&quot; by human rights groups, and that he was cleaning up problems inherited from his predecessor, General Romeo Lucas Garcia. Ironically, Garcia had given $500,000 to Reagan's 1980 campaign, and his henchman, Mario Sandoval Alarcon, the &quot;Godfather&quot; of Central American death squads, was a guest at Reagan's first inaugural celebration.

By one estimate, his fortune exceeded $96 billion in present-day dollars. Before this, passengers and mail either went around Cape Horn of South America or through a competing sea and overland route through Panama, well before the canal had been built. Vanderbilt pushes for the Nicaragua route to shave several days off these routes and to gain the prize of the American mail contract (mail between the American coasts traveled the Panama route and was worth several hundred millions of dollars in today's money).\r\n<br>\r\nBecause the British also had colonial plans for Nicaragua, these ventures would result in conflict over the next decade.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div>	large	f
45	The Dutch Capture of Recife	1621	1630	bra4	power	The Making of New World Slavery by Robin Blackburn	<div class="page" data-title="West Indian Company"></div>\r\n<p class="entry" style="position:relative;left:760px;width:365px;top:-9px;">\r\n&emsp;With the founding of the Dutch West India Company (WIC) in 1621, there is the emergence of a new type of aggressive and plundering bourgeoisie. Partly modeled on the VOC, or East India Trading Company, which had taken over much of Portugal's spice trade and seized a number of its fortified islands. In contrast to Eastern traders, the well-armed Dutch vessels generally refused to pay dues or tribute to local rulers; where necessary, the destroyed competitive suppliers and established their own. Their ships also took on, where needed, the pirates who ravaged the trade of the Indian Ocean and China seas. On the other hand, the Dutch VOC did not allow military expenses to outweigh the profits of trade, as was happening with the Portuguese in Asia by the close of the sixteenth century.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nLike the trading empire of the Portuguese king, the Dutch companies were integrated, nonspecialized enterprises, but with one remarkable difference. By producing their own protection, the companies not only expropriated the tribute but also became able to determine the quality and costs of protection themselves. This meant that protection costs were brought within range of rational calculation instead of being in the unpredictable region of 'the acts of God or the king's enemies.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn 1623-24, the VOC dispatched an expedition of eleven ships and 1,650 men to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, while the WIC sent a reconnoitering squadron to the Caribbean and a larger force, compromising twenty-three ships, to capture Bahia, Brazil's capital. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Recife"></div>\r\n<p class="entry" style="position:relative;left:760px;width:365px;top:-9px;">\r\nThe Portuguese forces and Brazilian militia mounted a stiff resistance but could not being prevent the city being seized, together with 70,000 <i>arrobas</i> of sugar awaiting shipment.\r\nWhen news of the capture reached the Peninsula a large force was immediately assembled for the relief of Bahia, the so-called 'expedition of the vassals'. This was commanded by a Spanish admiral, but was of overwhelmingly Portuguese composition. Numbering no fewer than 52 ships and 12,000 men, it captured Bahia after a Dutch occupation of less than a year.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe next major WIC coup was the capture of the Spanish silver fleet off the coast of Cuba in 1628 by a Dutch fleet of thirty ships; this was to be the only occasion on which the <i>flota</i> was lost to enemy action (this caused major havoc for the Spanish power).\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe Spanish silver allows the WIC to resuscitate its plans to seize Brazil, demonstrating by doing so why its special privileges and powers were justified. IT assembled an expedition for a renewed assault on Brazil in 1629-30, compromising 67 ships and 7,000 men. This succeeded in capturing the twin cities of Recife and Olinda, respectfully the major port and the capital of the colony's most important sugar-producing captaincy, Pernambuco. While a Spanish naval force failed to dislodge the WIC, the Dutch did not pacify the interior of Pernambuco until 1636 and hostilities hampered sugar output for years to come.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	large	f

By 1955\r\nthe fiber had replaced coffee as Nicaragua’s leading export. Cotton acreage\r\nincreased more than five times between 1951 and 1955, and production\r\nincreased almost ten times. Once the breadbasket of Nicaragua, the area\r\naround León was transformed into a dust bowl as plantation owners cut\r\ndown forests and expelled tenant farmers and Indian communities from\r\ntheir land. During the spring dry season, hot winds blew dust into every\r\ncorner of the city, and the air in León stank of pesticide.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;The rate of growth in agriculture alone during the 1950s and 1960s averaged nearly 5 percent a year,\r\none of the highest in the world. The explosion of cotton production starting\r\nin 1950 was joined in the next decade by a sharp increase in the export of beef,\r\na traditional Nicaraguan product, and the beginning of large-scale commercial\r\nproduction of sugar, seafood, tobacco, and bananas for export. The new\r\nCentral American Common Market led to a modest amount of industrialization,\r\nespecially in first-stage processing of agricultural products and the\r\npackaging of insecticide and fertilizer. Alliance for Progress–sponsored programs\r\ncreated some public sector jobs in the civil service and education, and\r\nagricultural and industrial expansion led to a growth in managerial and\r\ncommercial employment. U.S. economic aid in 1968 was twenty-seven times\r\nwhat it had been in 1960. A construction boom in the capital produced new\r\nmiddle-class neighborhoods. Downtown Managua acquired a real commercial\r\ndistrict, with shops stocking U.S.-made goods for newly affluent consumers.\r\nThe Nicaraguan middle class, still small even by Latin American\r\nstandards, was culturally very much oriented to the United States.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Most of the Nicaraguan population did not benefit from the economic\r\nboom. In the countryside, the distribution of wealth was more unequal than\r\never. In 1963, the top 0.1 percent of the rural population owned 20 percent of\r\nthe land, and the bottom half made do with about 3 percent. Cotton was not\r\na crop for small producers, and by the mid-1960s, 90 percent of cotton\r\nacreage was in the hands of large landowners. The growth of cotton production\r\nin the 1950s and 1960s was responsible for a greater degree of proletarianization\r\nof the peasantry than any previous crop. With the expansions\r\nof coffee production and cattle ranching in the nineteenth and early twentieth\r\ncenturies, small landowners had tended to be pushed into tenant arrangements\r\nor displaced onto the agricultural frontier. It was not until the\r\nadvent of cotton, the most profitable and highly mechanized crop in Nicaraguan\r\nhistory, that large numbers of peasants lost access to land altogether\r\nand, in many cases, migrated to the cities. Thousands poured into the barrios\r\norientales on the east side of Managua, sprawling communities of new urbanites,\r\nmany of whom traveled back to the cotton zone each year to work\r\nduring the harvest season. The population of the capital doubled during the\r\n1950s, to about 230,000, and then nearly doubled again in the course of the\r\n1960s. Although the middle class was concentrated in the capital, the majority\r\nof the city’s population was poor; in 1969 three-quarters of Managua\r\nhouseholds got by on less than $100 a month. By the end of the 1960s, nearly\r\nhalf the population of Nicaragua lived in urban areas, with Managua dwarfing\r\nall other cities and towns.</p></div>	large	f
49	Revolt against the Dutch 	1644	1646	bra1	power	The Making of New World Slavery by Robin Blackburn	<p class="entry columns3">\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nWith the departure of the capable governor Prince Maurits, there was a rapid deterioration in the\r\nDutch position. In June 1645 the moradores of Pernambuco rose in revolt\r\nagainst the increasingly intolerant and grasping policy of the Company.\r\nThis was led by Fernandes Vieira, who formed a terço that came to number\r\n1,800 men. The owner of a large estate in colonial Brazil would have his\r\nown armed henchmen [<i>agregados</i>] as well as <i>lavradores</i> dependent on him.\r\nDutch attempts to foreclose on loans and to prevent Catholic worship in\r\npublic in the capital alienated the <i>moradores</i>. The revolt acquired a\r\ndistinctly Brazilian character, but no doubt it was also strengthened by the\r\nstronger claims on Portuguese loyalty that could be exercised by the\r\nrestored monarchy in Lisbon. The Portuguese authorities did not publicly\r\nwelcome the revolt, but after some hesitation they did extend clandestine\r\nsupport to the rebels, conferring commissions on the leaders and sending\r\n150 experienced soldiers.\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nFrom the outset the rebellion was strengthened by the adhesion of Indian\r\nand black commanders who had never reconciled themselves to the Dutch.\r\nThe Portuguese had been in Brazil for well over a century, and the colonial\r\nsocial formation incorporated several thousands of Indians and free blacks,\r\nmost of them Catholics, the former organized under their own chiefs and\r\nthe latter with their own brotherhoods. In 1646 the black captain Henrique\r\nDias, <i>pictured</i>, led a column of 330 blacks, while the Indian Felipe Camarao led 460\r\nIndian fighters; together they comprised nearly a quarter of the Portuguese\r\nforces at this time, and proved militarily very effective. The Portuguese\r\nauthorities were aware of the value of support from Indians and blacks,\r\nand made some ideological concessions to encourage it. The Jesuit priest\r\n<a data-entry="870" data-year="1653" class="inline">Antonio Vieira</a>, already well-known in Portugal and Brazil for the brilliant\r\noratory of his sermons, vigorously castigated the Portuguese colonists for\r\nthe harsh way they treated Indians and blacks.\r\n<img src="/mapimages/henriquediasbrazil.png" class="floatright">\r\n\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe participation of Indians and blacks in the 'liberation' struggle was\r\nsubsequently to be the subject of much mythopoeic celebration by colonial\r\nand Imperial ideologists; an Henrique Dias regiment formed part of the\r\nBrazilian armed forces for over two hundred years. But both the Portuguese\r\nand the Dutch were most careful not to attack the institution of slavery.\r\nSome individual slaves were offered manumission if they would become\r\nsoldiers, but the mass of slaves were kept hard at work. As the revolt\r\nunfolded it sometimes afforded slaves the opportunity to escape; <i>quilombos</i>\r\nof slaves who had freed themselves in this way formed in the interior, such\r\nas the famous black republic of <a data-entry="36" data-year="1646" class="inline">Palmares</a>. But these fissures in the slave\r\nsystem were no plan of the plan of either side in the conflict.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe rebels repulsed Dutch columns sent against them, and greatly\r\ndisrupted the sugar economy. By 1646 the Company sent back only 55,800\r\narrobas of sugar, while the private traders did even worse, with cargoes of\r\njust under 20,000 arrobas, representing a total harvest of less than a quarter\r\nof the yields achieved in the early 1640s. Since the WIC used profits on\r\nsugar sales to finance its operations, this was a heavy blow.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="columns" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n"One of the remarkable things witnessed in the world today, and which we, because of our daily habits, do not see as strange, \r\nis the immense transmigration of Ethiopian peoples and nations who are constantly crossing over from Africa to this America \r\n… we can say that the ships which one after the other are entering our ports are carrying Africa to Brazil….\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThere is not a slave in Brazil—and especially when I gaze upon the most miserable among them—who for me is not an \r\nobject of profound meditation. When I compare the present with the future, time with eternity, that which I see with that \r\nwhich I believe, I cannot accept the idea that God, who created these people as much in His own image as He did the rest of \r\nus, would have predestined them for two hells, one in this life and another in the next. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nYou are the brothers of God’s preparation and the children of God’s fire.

The first he appropriated from nationalist\r\nhero and guerrilla general Augusto César Sandino: "<i>Only the workers and\r\npeasants will go all the way.</i>" The second, featured on the front page of the\r\nFSLN newspaper on 8 November, declared: "<i>It is not simply a question of\r\nchanging the individuals in power, but rather of changing the system, of\r\noverthrowing the exploiting classes and bringing the exploited classes to\r\nvictory.</i>"\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n&emsp;Fonseca outlined his view of history and its relevance for the present in a\r\npublic talk he gave in Havana in October 1973. In this speech, information\r\nabout the past was presented as a revolutionary weapon, no less important\r\nthan the other arms soldiers carried:\r\n<span class="blockquote"><i>\r\n"Those of us who propose to wage a struggle to liberate our country and\r\nmake freedom a reality must rescue our own traditions and put together\r\nthe facts and figures we need in order to wage an ideological war against\r\nour enemy.

I would even say that, to the same extent that we\r\nare able to use our rifles effectively, we will also be able to revive our\r\npeople’s historical traditions, and to the same extent that we master our\r\npopular traditions, we will also find ourselves able to use our rifles\r\nsuccessfully against the enemy."</i></span>\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Fonseca told peasant women, <i>"The most important thing is for\r\nthe campesinas to understand that they have to participate, that they have to\r\nfree themselves from this mistaken idea their husbands have planted in their\r\nheads, which keeps them from working in the organizations and understanding\r\nthey have the same rights. These are things we have to change."</i>\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;He is shot in a National Guard ambush and dies the next day. His hands are cut off and sent Managua for identification. President Somoza was at the symphony in Managua that\r\nnight when a high-ranking National Guard officer rushed in and told him,\r\n"General, the communist Carlos Fonseca is dead. I swear to you that this\r\ntime he’s dead, if we are wrong again, you can kill us." According to an\r\nobserver, the president jumped up, grabbed the messenger by the shoulders,\r\ndemanded, "Say it again! Say it again!" and rushed out of the theater.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	large	f

In 1932, a civil war broke out in São Paulo, provoked by regional demands that the Vargas regime meet its commitment to reinstate constitutional law. Defeated on the battlefield, the paulistas still managed to pressure Vargas into accepting the formation of a Constituent Assembly. The assembly completed its work in early 1934, and the return to constitutional rule followed soon after. Legalists were saddened to see that ratification of the new constitution and the return to popular elections would not guarantee social or political peace. In November 1935, leftist soldiers quartered in the Northeast and Rio mutinied in hopes of inciting a popular uprising against the landholding elite. The central government responded to the so-called Intentona Comunista with ferocity, quickly putting down the rebellion. The state of siege and anti-leftist purges that followed the failed uprising circumscribed all democratic institutions. The presidential elections slated for 1938 neared under the specter of state violence. In early November 1937,Vargas’s military advisors fabricated evidence of another communist insurgency as a pretext for suspending the presidential elections and instituting an authoritarian-nationalist regime. According to Vargas, the Estado Novo (New State) announced on November 10 was supposed to restore to the Brazilian people an organic political culture that had been corrupted by liberalism during the First Republic and threatened by communism in the constitutional period. This Estado Novo was built on the state’s real and implied use of violence against any and all threats to the nation.\r\nMetaphors and monuments of war were ubiquitous under the Estado Novo. In the interior, federal troops, technicians, and settlers were sent on a ‘‘march’’ to conquer theWest. In the capital, the federal government erected monuments to the military heroism of nineteenth-century warriors Admiral Joaquim Marques Tamandaré (1807-97) and Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca, as well as government troops martyred at the Retreat at Laguna (1867) and the Intentona Comunista (1935).5 The state coordinated a Campanha da Borracha (Rubber Campaign) to help stimulate rubber production. In conjunction with the Rockefeller Foundation, the federal government organized an army of sanitation workers and public information campaigns in an attack on tropical and venereal diseases. Civil engineers and public health officials looked to the Baixada Fluminense, a particularly unhealthy region located to the north of the federal capital, as a battleground against miseryand underdevelopment. In the interior of theNortheast, bounty hunters pursued a guerrilla war against cangaceiros (outlaws) in hopes of stamping out the scourges of rural banditry and bossism. In 1939, the most notorious of the rural bandits, Lampião (Virgolino Ferreira da Silva),was captured and decapitated.His head,which remained on public display in Salvador da Bahia for three decades, was yet another prize in the regime’s war against internal disorder.\r\n<img src="/mapimages/estadonovovargas.jpg" class="floatleft" style="height:336px;width:500px;">\r\n\r\nOn the morning of November 29, 1937, Vargas presided over the symbolic attack upon the political culture of federalism, watching as the flags of all Brazilian states were ritually burned in a pyre mounted along Rio’s Russell Beach. The infamous Queima das Bandeiras (Burning of the Flags) was not merely a celebration of national unity, but rather an assault upon regional autonomy, individual rights, and political liberties.When Vargas’s civilian, military, and ecclesiastical allies watched the symbols of regional sovereignty go up in flames, they lent their support to the state’s attack upon elements of Brazilian society deemed threatening. Unbending regional elites, communists, liberal republicans, Jews, and unacculturated immigrants would bear the brunt of a broader assault on groups that did not conform to the regime’s vision of Brazilian society. The Estado Novo anticipated a militarized technology of internal surveillance, policing, repression, and countersubversion that took on horrid proportions during the military regime of 1964-85.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNationalism was perhaps, in this period, the identifiable common denominator of the military's political orientations in the several Latin American countries. The officers' seemingly ambiguous behaviour, often more authoritarian than reformist even in the 'revolutionary' experiments, always had its roots in their underlying concern, even in the pursuit of social justice, to reinforce the human, economic and therefore military potential of their nations. This orientation accorded with the policies of independent, inward-looking development through import substitution industrialization, which were beginning to be adopted at the time. This national-militarist current, which was not systematically opposed to change if carried out in an orderly fashion, nor to improvements in the labouring classes' conditions if accomplished under the state's tutelage, seems to have been dominant in the armed forces. \r\n<br>\r\nBrazil's trade union structure dates from the Estado Novo. Vargas' model was Mussolini's labor code, which states that trade\r\nunions are subordinate to the Ministry of Labor. Union membership is obligatory. The Ministry controls the finances, collecting members' dues and apportioning funds within the trade union structure. It can intervene in union affairs, removing officers and appointing its own nominees in certain cases.<br>\r\nWithout multiplying the examples, suffice it to recall that in Brazil, not only did numerous officers show an affinity for <i>integralismo</i>, but the Estado Novo itself was founded in 1937 by a general staff imbued with similar attitudes. General Pedro Goes Monteiro, minister of war (1934—37) and army chief of staff (1937—44), who hoped &quot;progressively to increase state power&quot; and who was a fascist sympathizer and pro-German, listed among the great men of the day, who embodied the political experiments he admired:&quot;Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin, Mustafa Kemal Pacha, Roosevelt and Salazar&quot;. <br> They had, in his view, each in his own way, succeeded in 'creating new organs and new state institutions, thereby furnishing the state with the means to overcome the domestic crisis'. The political ideal of the Estado Novo's most important military potentate was, in brief, that &quot;the state must have the power to intervene to regulate the whole of collective life and to discipline the nation.&quot; \r\n<br>Repression of the left was intensified after the failed Communist-military risings of November 1935, and the Integralists were forcefully suppressed after the failure of their May 1938 coup attempt. The Italian and German communities of southern Brazil naturally contained many Axis sympathizers, and were also Integralist strongholds. The Estado Novo imposed censorship and relied on a powerful secret police apparatus. Immigrant enclaves with their own schools, newspapers and autonomous civic organizations were now brought under central control and required to promote the Portuguese language. The German community, in particular, was forced in 1938 to choose between its allegiance to the Reich and its allegiance to Brazil, and thousands left for Europe in disgust. An August 1938 decree provided that conscripts must only speak Portuguese during their military training. \r\nIt is decided officially in 1942 to deny military school access to non-Catholics (especially Jews) and blacks, and also to the children of immigrants, political opponents, and divorcees or concubines.\r\nThe large Japanese community in Brazil was also subject to these measures, although in practice it preserved a large degree of separateness, at least until the shock of the Emperor's surrender in 1945. For several years thereafter a substantial sector of the Japanese community persisted in believing this to be a lie, propaganda invented by the Brazilian and western press.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</div>	large	t

Rodriguez	<p class="entry columns" style="width:800px;"><font class="intro">Enslaved Afro-Cubans forced by the Spanish administration to work the copper mines of Santiago del Prado, also known as El Cobre, on the island of Cuba, flee into the mountains.</font>\r\n\r\nIn the early 1500s, the Spanish settled near the copper mines of Santiago\r\ndel Prado, also known as El Cobre, on the island of Cuba. In the 1530s,\r\nthey introduced African slaves to work in the mines, but the Spanish later\r\nabandoned the mines for many years. During this time, the former African\r\nslaves established their own communities in the area. It is also important to\r\nnote that El Cobre became the site of a shrine to Our Lady of Charity of El\r\nCobre dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The Virgin would become an important\r\nunifying symbol for the slaves as they struggled for their freedom.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn 1731, the Spanish attempted to enslave the Afro-Cuban descendants of\r\nthe slaves who had once worked the mines. Since the Spanish crown\r\nowned and operated the mines, these men and women became royal slaves.\r\nUpset at abuses of their rights by the government, they demanded greater\r\nautonomy and refused to march in a military parade. The Afro-Cubans were\r\nencouraged by their belief in the Virgin, whom they believed protected\r\nthem and gave them the right to the land upon which they lived. In\r\nresponse, they fled into the nearby mountains. To demonstrate the importance\r\nof the Virgin, the slaves tried unsuccessfully to remove the statue of\r\nthe Virgin from the shrine.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nPedro Ignacio Ximenez, the governor of Cuba, condemned the runaways\r\nfor their actions. When he discovered the leaders of the plot, he had thirty-six\r\nof them exiled. However, two years later in 1733, the King of Spain\r\ndefended his royal slaves, ordering that they be treated without oppression\r\nand showing that they enjoyed certain entitlements as slaves of the crown.\r\nNevertheless, tension between the slaves and the local government\r\ncontinued.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn 1780, the Spanish government privatized the mines, leading to a loss\r\nof privileges for the slaves. In 1783, the slaves prepared a document in\r\nwhich they protested the loss of their privileged status as royal slaves. They\r\ncited the power of the Virgin to protect them. This tactic seemed to work,\r\nas the daughter of the Cuban governor fell ill and was cured with the aid of\r\nthe Virgin. To show his gratitude, the governor did not immediately hand\r\nthe slaves over to their new, private owners.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nBetween 1780 and 1800, the slaves struggled to gain their freedom\r\nthrough flight, violence, and litigation. Finally, in April 1800, the Spanish\r\ncrown granted their freedom in a royal edict that was read at the steps of\r\nthe shrine of the Virgin. Although the former slaves still had certain labor obligations, it was still seen as a remarkable achievement.\r\n</p>	large	f

873	Francisco Cuadrado Prats and the Death of Pinochet	2006	2006	chi2	redfist	Excerpted from Spitting on the dead dictator By ARIEL DORFMAN	<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:.9em;">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/pinochetcoffin.jpg" class="floatleft">\r\n&emsp;"When General Augusto Pinochet breathed his last on Dec. 10, this much seemed clear to everybody in Chile: The man who had lived his whole life and never paid for even one of his crimes had done it again. Once more—one final time—everybody in Chile thought that Pinochet had escaped judgment. Everybody, that is, except for a young man named Francisco Cuadrado Prats, who decided that some sort of punishment, no matter how symbolic, was merited. So he walked up to Pinochet's coffin and deliberately, calmly spat on the dictator's face as he lay there in full regalia.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;The grandfather of the young man, Gen. Carlos Prats, was commander in chief of the Chilean army. Feeling he could no longer stop the impending military coup against President Salvador Allende, Prats resigned his post and recommended that his replacement be the most loyal of his generals, a man he had befriended and protected his whole life—Augusto Pinochet.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;I was working at the presidential palace and can remember how glad, almost giddy, we were when Allende followed Prats' advice. At a farewell gathering honoring Prats, the name Pinochet was on all our lips. He was someone we could trust, someone who would save democracy and avoid the violence descending upon us. Among those present at the party were Allende's last two ministers of defense, Jose Toha and Orlando Letelier. They relied on their "friend" Augusto, "good old Pinochet," to rescue the republic from disaster.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;One week later, Sept. 11, 1973, Allende was dead, Toha and Letelier were prisoners of a military junta and Prats had been banished to Argentina. Pinochet had betrayed his president, his friends and his country.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;But that was not enough. The new ruler had to be rid of the men who had believed in him, who had seen him obsequiously swearing allegiance to the president, who had witnessed his duplicity. Toha was murdered in a Chilean dungeon a few months after the coup. Letelier was assassinated in Washington in 1976. As to Carlos Prats, he and his wife were blown up on a Buenos Aires street on Sept. 30, 1974, by agents of Pinochet's secret police.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;But not all was despair. The grandson would also watch and participate in the Chileans' movement to defeat the dictator and recover their lost democracy. By 1990, Pinochet no longer ruled the country. But for the next eight years, he thwarted the emergence of a full democracy by using various authoritarian features of the system and his role as commander in chief of the army. He threatened rebellion at whim, publicly warning Chile's elected leaders, for instance, that if they dared touch, let alone prosecute, one of the men under his command, he would rise up again. There appeared to be virtually no chance that justice would be done.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Then, almost miraculously, Pinochet was arrested in London in 1998 after Spanish authorities charged him with murder, torture, illegal detention and disappearances. He escaped extradition to Spain by feigning dementia, but upon his return to Chile, he found that the country had changed. Some of the fear he had inspired was gone. The judiciary and politicians, shamed before the world by the charges issued in Spain, were ready to indict him for all manner of human rights violations. Among the cases was the murder of Carlos Prats and his wife, Sophia.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;But Pinochet's lawyers, often with the connivance of sluggish judges and a wary political class, successfully delayed the numerous proceedings against the dictator, and he never was convicted of anything. (Chilean judges denied on a technicality an Argentine magistrate's demand that the general be extradited for trial in Prats' murder.)\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Then, just when death seemed to protect Pinochet from punishment, insult was added to injury when the former dictator was rewarded with funeral rites he didn't deserve. Although President Michelle Bachelet (herself a torture victim whose father died of maltreatment in Pinochet's prisons) refused to give the dead dictator a state funeral, she could not stop the army from burying him with full honors.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;It was too much for Prats' grandson.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Let me confess that spitting on a dead man—even if he is responsible for the deaths of so many of my friends, the devastation of my life and the agony of my country—makes me feel queasy and uncomfortable. There is something sacred about the dead, about their sad vulnerability, about the rules and protocols that we need to honor when a life, no matter how miserable, has ended.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Yet, who can blame Francisco Cuadrado Prats? His was the tiniest of revolts, barely two or three seconds long (after which he was beaten and kicked by rabid Pinochet supporters before being rescued by a group of military policemen), but it spoke for his murdered grandparents and for all the mutilated and missing bodies of his land. It expressed what millions of Chileans had long dreamed of doing and what only one of us finally dared to do."\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>	large	f

Many natives of Haiti anticipated the fate imposed by their white oppressors: they killed their children and committed mass suicide.

This action took place during the course of\r\ntwo years.<br>\r\n&emsp;The fact that an American entrepreneur could induce the US government\r\nto act against a supposedly sovereign state, and that a US\r\nfilibusterer, as Walker was then known, could invade and take over a\r\ncountry, left an indelible impression on Nicaraguans—one that was\r\npassed on to future generations.\r\n<img src="/mapimages/executionofwilliamwalker.jpg" style="width:100%;column-span: all;COLSPAN=2;">\r\n</p>	large	f

But the Communist Party and main sectors of the Socialist Party told people to wind down the <i>cordones</i> and trust in the ‘constitutional’ traditions of the army. Allende brought generals, including Augusto Pinochet, into his government, believing this would placate the right and maintain order. <br>\r\nBut on September 11, the military strikes again.<br>\r\nDuring the fighting, the military demanded that President allende surrender, and made a perfunctory offer to fly him and his family out of the country. In a now famous audiotape of General Pinochet issuing instructions to his troops via radio communications on September 11, he is heard to laugh and swear &quot;that plane will never land.&quot; Forecasting the savagery of his regime, Pincohet added: <strong>&quot;Kill the bitch and you eliminate the litter.&quot;</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nAt around nine o'clock Allende stepped onto the balcony for a final, forlorn look over Constitution Square. Half an hour later, through a makeshift radio hookup, he addressed his last words to his people.\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Allende delivered his impassioned farewell, infantry units began advancing on the palace under cover of artillery fire. Defenders\r\nfired back, and men on both sides fell. Shortly before noon, two British-made Hawker Hunter fighters roared out of the sky. They swooped down and fired at the palace, striking so accurately that one missile flew right through the palace's main door. Eighteen rockets hit the old building, which burst into flames. Inside, the air filled with smoke and fumes.\r\n<br>\r\n Salvador Allende was found dead from gunshot wounds in his inner office around 2:00 p.m. At 2:300 p.m., the armed forces radio network broadcast an announcement that La Moneda had &quot;surrendered&quot; and that the entire country was under military control.\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Pinochet's first acts after the coup was to order a nationwide series of raids on leftists and other supporters of the deposed regime, known as "the Caravan of Death". The harshness with which this campaign was conducted, the tens of thousands of people\r\n who were arrested, the conditions under which they were held, \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n<td  width="60%"  valign="top">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src="/mapimages/allendeslaststand-bg.jpg" style="position:relative;right:0px;top:-12px;">\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns" style=" font-size:.9em;">\r\n\r\nand the fact that many were never seen again set the tone for what would be years of repression. The regime ordered summary executions for scores of leftist leaders. Many more died at the hands of soldiers and rightist thugs\r\nwho swept through pro-Allende slums, called <i>poblaciones</i>, beating and killing as they rampaged.<br>\r\n  On October 8, Newsweek reported that city morgues in Santiago had received a total of 2,796 corpses since the coup, most with either crushed skulls or execution-style bullet wounds.<br>\r\nOfficials of the Allende government were rounded up and sent to a prison on desolate Dawson Island, in Chile's extreme south. The junta abolished the country's largest labor federation, which had 800,000 members; banned all political parties that had supported Allende; declared Congress in "indefinite recess "; summarily dismissed hundreds of university professors; removed all mayors and city councillors from office; and decreed a new legal code that forbade any appeal of decisions by military courts. Gleeful militiamen made bonfires of leftist books.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThousands are rounded up into a sports stadium and massacred. </p>\r\n</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Allende's Last Words"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="columns3" style="color:white; font-size: 1.03em; line-height: 1.1em;">\r\n<audio controls>\r\n <source src="/mapimages/salvador_allende_11sept_1973.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">\r\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\r\n</audio>\r\n<br>\r\n"Surely, this will be the last opportunity for me to address you.&nbsp; The Air Force has bombed the antennas of Radio Magallanes.&nbsp; My words do not have bitterness but disappointment.&nbsp; May they be a moral punishment for those who have betrayed their oath: soldiers of Chile, titular commanders in chief, Admiral Merino, who has designated himself Commander of the Navy, and Mr. Mendoza, the despicable general who only yesterday pledged his fidelity and loyalty to the Government, and who also has appointed himself Chief of the Carabineros [paramilitary police].&nbsp; Given these facts, the only thing left for me is to say to workers: I am not going to resign!\r\n<br><br>\r\nPlaced in a historic transition, I will pay for loyalty to the people with my life.&nbsp; And I say to them that I am certain that the seeds which we have planted in the good conscience of thousands and thousands of Chileans will not be shriveled forever.&nbsp; They have force and will be able to dominate us, but social processes can be arrested by neither crime nor force.&nbsp; History is ours, and people make history.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWorkers of my country: I want to thank you for the loyalty that you always had, the confidence that you deposited in a man who was only an interpreter of great yearnings for justice, who gave his word that he would respect the Constitution and the law and did just that.&nbsp; At this definitive moment, the last moment when I can address you, I wish you to take advantage of the lesson: foreign capital, imperialism, together with the reaction, created the climate in which the Armed Forces broke their tradition, the tradition taught by General Schneider and reaffirmed by Commander Araya, victims of the same social sector who today are hoping, with foreign assistance, to re-conquer the power to continue defending their profits and their privileges.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI address you, above all, the modest woman of our land, the campesina who believed in us, the mother who knew our concern for children.&nbsp; I address professionals of Chile, patriotic professionals who continued working against the sedition that was supported by professional associations, classist associations that also defended the advantages of capitalist society.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI address the youth, those who sang and gave us their joy and their spirit of struggle.&nbsp; I address the man of Chile, the worker, the farmer, the intellectual, those who will be persecuted, because in our country fascism has been already present for many hours -- in terrorist attacks, blowing up the bridges, cutting the railroad tracks, destroying the oil and gas pipelines, in the face of the silence of those who had the obligation to act.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThey were committed.&nbsp; History will judge them.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSurely, Radio Magallanes will be silenced, and the calm metal instrument of my voice will no longer reach you.&nbsp; It does not matter.&nbsp; You will continue hearing it.&nbsp; I will always be next to you.&nbsp; At least my memory will be that of a man of dignity who was loyal to his country.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe people must defend themselves, but they must not sacrifice themselves.&nbsp; The people must not let themselves be destroyed or riddled with bullets, but they cannot be humiliated either.\r\n<img src="/mapimages/palacechilecoup-small.jpg">\r\n<br><br>\r\nWorkers of my country, I have faith in Chile and its destiny.&nbsp; Other men will overcome this dark and bitter moment when treason seeks to prevail.&nbsp; Keep in mind that, much sooner than later, great avenues will again be opened, through which will pass the free man, to construct a better society.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLong live  Chile!&nbsp; Long live the people!&nbsp; Long live the workers!\r\n<br><br>\r\nThese are my last words, and I am certain that my sacrifice will not be in vain, I am certain that, at the very least, it will be a moral lesson that will punish felony, cowardice, and treason."\r\n<br><em>Santiago de Chile, <br>\r\n\t\t\t\t  11 September 1973</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Estadio Nacional"></div>\r\n<p class="columns3" style="width:920px;background:#E8E8E8;padding:0px 9px;">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/estadionacional.jpg" style="float:right;padding:0px 10px;">\r\n\r\n<i>\r\nAdam Schesch, a survivor of coup, was imprisoned in the National Stadium along with his wife, Patricia. Mr. Schesch was eventually released after friends put pressure on the American State Department to intervene, which it relunctantly did. After 10 days, he and his wife were handed over to someone from US Embassy. The following morning they were flown back to the States. They have never been back to Chile.</i><br>\r\n\r\n"There were two lines. We called them the line of life and the line of death. One line led out, away from the stadium, the other led inside. The demeanour of people in the one line seemed relaxed. The people in the other line were heavily guarded. They seemed stunned, stolid-faced. They were taking people into the stadium about 20 at a time, several times a day. It was men and women. Mainly adults. Mainly working-class people. There were a lot of native Indians. We never saw those people again. \r\n<br>\r\nWe were totally unprepared. We did not know what to do. They basically just threw us down against a concrete wall where we were held for 10 days while they questioned us. If we wanted to go to the toilet they took us to a room containing about 75 people. We saw people being beaten up and taken off for torture. At one point they brought in two teenagers who had been fighting against the anti-government forces and they beat them up in front of us.\r\n<br>\r\nJust before they led the one line out into the stadium, they would start the extractor fans in the changing rooms just to make some noise. They did not want people to know what was happening. Then they would lead the line of people out of the changing rooms into the stadium. There was a concrete wall between where I was being held and the stadium but I could hear everything. On one occasion my wife heard the people in the stadium singing `the Internationale'. Then the machine-guns started. The gunfire would last for 45 seconds, maybe a minute, and then there was no sound. Then someone would come back in and turn off the fans."\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nDeclassified U.S. government documents reveal that the CIA closely followed what was taking place in the Stadium. The agency proved discerning in its assessment of the Chilean military’s account of both the number of prisoners and the behavior of the interrogators. One document also reveals that in their efforts to “manage” the stadium’s burgeoning number of prisoners, Chilean general Nicanor Díaz and Brigadier General Francisco Herrera specifically approached a U.S. government agent to seek assistance, including a technical advisor that “must have knowledge in the establishment and operation of a detention center.”\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entry" style="font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;width:200px;position:relative;left:980px;top:-530px;">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Former non-commissioned officer Roberto Saldias said on national television that he saw prisoners taken off for execution at the stadium when he was on guard duty, he is the first former army officer to confirm the stories publicly and without concealing his identity.\r\n<br>\r\n"They took the law in their own hands," he said, adding he was prepared to provide the names of the executioners.\r\nPrisoners at the stadium were organized in groups identified by yellow, black and red discs.

He was a 37 years-old lawyer, manager of the Corfo Corporation in the city of Antofagasta in northern Chile, also President of the Chilean Socialist Party in the same city and President of the Unidad Popular party. Mario Silva was married, with five children aged between 2 and 15 years. Testimony given on 30 September 2008:</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="columns3" style="color:white;font-size:1.05em;">\r\n"In the context of the military coup of 11 September 1973, the army took power in all the cities of the country and arrested all those in authority. Antofagasta was under siege and the atmosphere was terrifying. My father was called to report to the army and our home was raided and ransacked by the military. We were forced to leave the house with our mother.\r\n<br>\r\nGiven that my father had a position of trust in the government of President Salvador Allende, he was in Santiago attending work meetings during those days. Because of the seriousness of the situation, the Mexican Ambassador offered him political asylum. He did not accept it because his family was unprotected in Antofagasta. He was convinced that the Chilean Army is republican, loyal, and anti-coup. Under this belief he traveled back to Antofagasta where he found his family scattered between friends' houses.\r\n<br>\r\nOn 13 September 1973 he gave himself up to the army. When he said good bye to us, his children, he showed his hands saying that they were clean and that he had done nothing wrong. We never saw him again. Only through stories from other people we learned what was happening in the detention centres, learning that people were brutally tortured. As my father was a lawyer, the President of the local Lawyers’ Association came to the detention centre to visit him and to offer counsel, this was denied. This is recorded in the testimonies which are part of the legal proceedings underway in Chile.\r\n<br>\r\nOn 19 October 1973, a helicopter landed in our city. This was an army delegation under the command of General Sergio Arellano Stark, who was under personal orders from and invested by Augusto Pinochet with power to remove all political prisoners from the city and execute them. At dawn on that morning, 14 people were massacred without trial, without charges, totally illegal.\r\n<br>\r\nThey were massacred in such a way that according to the forensic doctor’s statement it was impossible to assemble the bodies, because of the impacts of machine gun fire. The family was not informed. At 9 am my mother goes to the prison to request information on the current situation and she was told “What are you looking for? They are all dead”. We begged for the bodies to be returned to us as they have lined them in the street outside the morgue. The army authority finally gave us the bodies on condition that we leave the city. We went to the city of Vallenar guarded by the army; we could not place his name on his grave. He lies in an unnamed grave."\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="The Embrace"></div>\r\n<p><img src="/mapimages/kissingerpinochet.jpg" style="float:left;padding:0px 10px;"></p>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="background:white;width:600px; height:275px;padding:9px;">\r\nPinochet moved quickly to resolve the conflicts with American companies that had contributed so decisively to hostility between Washington and Santiago. Less than a year after the coup, his government announced an agreement with Anaconda Copper under which the company would receive $253 million in cash and promissory notes for its expropriated assets. Kennecott Copper received $66.9 million. Chile also settled with ITT, paying the company $125.2 million for its interest in the Chilean Telephone Company.\r\n<br>\r\nIn 1976, Henry Kissinger traveled to Santiago to deliver a speech to the Organization of American States. The day before his public appearance, he met privately with Pinochet to assure him that although his speech would include a few perfunctory references to human rights, it was "not aimed at Chile."\r\n<br>\r\n"My evaluation is that you are a victim of all left-wing groups around the world, and that your greatest sin was that you overthrew a government that was going communist," Kissinger told Pinochet. "We welcomed the overthrow of the communist-inclined government here. We are not out to weaken your position."\r\n</p>	large	f

They disembarked at Acla, and Gil Gonzalez went to Darien, to secure the support of the governor, for his enterprise. The ships, having been built in the Rio de la Balsa, were sent down to the sea, passed the island of Pearls, and, Panama having been peopled in 1519, the flotilla was brought there. This Gil Gonzalez had to discover a certain number of leagues to the westward, concerning which the capitulation had been made; and thus he coasted along and arrived at the gulf of San Lucar, which had already been discovered by Pedrarias. It is at the commencement of the land of Nicaragua. Having passed the place where Leon and Granada now stand, he disembarked, and came to a village where he found one hundred thousand <i>pesos de oro</i>? As soon as his arrival was known in the land, a large force of warlike Indians came against him, and obliged him to fall back and embark again, as he had not sufficient force to resist them. He returned to Panama with the gold, and went thence to Spain; but returned to San Domingo, and equipped an expedition to settle in Nicaragua, going by way of Honduras.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;At this time Pedrarias sent one Francisco Hernandez de Cordova in command of a force, to subdue and settle Nicaragua; and he entered that land, subduing and conquering, and fighting in many skirmishes and battles. He founded the cities of Leon and Granada, and built fortresses in them, for defense. This land was very populous and fertile, yielding supplies of maize, and many fowls of the country, and certain small dogs which they also eat, and many deer and fish. It is a very salubrious land. The Indians were very civilized in their way of life, like those of Mexico, for they were a people who had come from that country, and they had nearly the same language (Five languages were spoken in Nicaragua. The <i>Charibizi</i>, the <i>Cholotecan</i> (being the most ancient), the <i>Choutal</i>, the <i>Orotinan</i>, and Mexican.). These people went about well dressed in the Indian fashion; the\r\nwomen with their mantles like those of Coiba, and another description of covering which, descending from the head, covered the bosom and half the arms. The men covered their loins with very long cloths made of cotton, which they passed in many folds from the hips to the thighs. In the villages they wore their mantles like cloaks under the arms. They had a great quantity of cotton cloth,\r\nand they held their markets in the open squares, where they traded. The land was poor in gold, and they traded with cacao, as in New Spain. \r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="...Sacrifice"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="height:455px;">\r\n<strong>1522</strong><i> Gil Gonzalez Davila explores Nicaragua, which he names after a cacique, Nicarao.</i>\r\n<br>\r\n"They had many beautiful women. Their parents had a custom, when they were maidens old enough to marry, of sending them to work for their marriages, and thus they went through the land working publicly, and as soon as they had wherewithal to furnish a house, they returned to their parents and were married. The husbands were so much under subjection that if they made their wives angry, they were turned out of doors, and the wives even raised their hands against them. The husband would go to the neighbors and beg them to ask his wife to let him come back, and not be angry with him. The wives made their husbands attend on them, and\r\ndo everything like servant lads. They had another custom, which was that when one of them was married, a man whom they held as a pope, and who lived in a temple, had to sleep with the bride on the previous night. In this temple there was a statue of gold, to which they sacrificed through the instrumentality of him who was there as priest, and their sacrifice was that, in the presence of the statue, they tore out the hearts of men and women who were sacrificed, and anointed the statue with them. They also cut out the tongues with certain stones like razors, and anointed the statue with them. Likewise they offered up much game and fish, and other eatables, and of these the priest, who resided there, did eat. The Indians made a sort of confession of certain sins which appeared to them to be heinous, and they thought that, by confessing them to this priest, they were freed from them.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;This is a land of abundance of good fruit, and of honey and wax, wherewith all the neighboring countries are supplied.\r\nThe bees are very numerous, some of them yellow, and these do not sting. They deposit the honey under the ground. There are many wolves in this land, which live upon the deer. They make wine from a kind of cherry, which is as strong as the wine of Spain, although the strength soon passes away. In all the countries I have mentioned the whole happiness of the people consists in drinking the wine they make from maize, which is like beer, and on this they get as drunk as if it was the wine of Spain, and all the festivals they hold, are for the purpose of drinking...\r\n<br>\r\n...This land is poor in gold. No mines have been found, except seventy leagues from Leon; and by taking the people from a warm and level country to dig out gold at such a distance and in high mountains, a very large part of the population has disappeared; and afterwards, there being no one to cultivate the land, the Spaniards began to make slaves, and to reward the chiefs who brought slaves to them. They were taken in great numbers to be sold at Panama and in Peru; and these are the reasons why this country is now so much depopulated."<br>\r\n<img src="/mapimages/gilgonzalezdavilaend2.gif">\r\n</p>	large	f

In 1962 two guerrilla movements had appeared in Guatemala, the 13 November Revolutionary Movement (MR 13 de Noviembre) and the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR). In Nicaragua the Sandinista National Liberation Forces (FSLN) was formally founded in 1961.\r\n<br> &emsp;In September 1962, in order to promote coordination, the United States sponsored a series of military exercises which were given the name 'Operation Brotherhood'. They involved armed units from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Colombia and the Canal Zone and they centered around a hypothetical guerrilla attack on Honduras national airport. In 1964, with strong United States backing, the defense ministers of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua signed an agreement establishing the Central American Defense Council (CONDECA). Costa Rica, whose army had been abolished in 1948, and Panama were given observer status with an option to join. \r\n<br> \r\n<img src="/mapimages/condeca.gif" style="max-width:100%;">\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;The Objectives of CONDECA were to coordinate action against internal subversion, and to facilitate United States control  over such action. The CIA and the Central American representatives of the United States armed forces acted as advisors to CONDECA. It was also seen as a convenient way of standardizing the training and equipping of the region's armies and reducing regional military rivalries. In addition, the United States tried to use the organization to promote the militarization of Costa Rica and in 1966 Costa Rica secretly took part in one of CONDECA joint maneuvers  known as  'Operation Nicarao.' \r\n<br> &emsp;Altogether some ten anti-guerrilla maneuvers were conducted under the auspice of CONDECA, the last one, 'Operation Aguila VI', took place in Nicaragua in 1976. In 1972 there were strong suggestions that the Nicaragua and Guatemalan air forces helped a right-wing government in El Salvador crush an attempted coup. \r\n<br> &emsp;However the organization never achieved the regional military coordination the United States had hoped for. Honduras withdrew after the war with El Salvador in 1969, and in 1979 the fall of Somoza, whose National Guard had been the backbone of the alliance, further contributed to its decline. By then the United States had in any case reached the conclusion than regional rivalries  and differences prevented the organization from becoming an effective instrument of coordinated counter-insurgency and had ceased to have a formal advisory role in is. Nevertheless, CONDECA has left a legacy of friendship and personal ties between the most right-wing army officers of the region and the idea of mutual assistance has not been abandoned.<br>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Postscript"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="height:500px">\r\n<strong>1962</strong> <i>\r\nU.S.-sponsored Operation Brotherhood, forerunner to CONDECA, stages military exercises with participation by Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. </i><br>\r\n<span style="font-size:90%">\r\nIn 1983, the Christian Scientist Monitor reported:<br>\r\n<i>\r\n&emsp;The Reagan administration is backing steps to reactivate the Central American Defense Council (CONDECA), a regional anticommunist military alliance that could play a role in Nicaragua similar to that of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States in Grenada. (President Reagan cited a request from OECS countries as one of the reasons for US intervention in Grenada.)\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Another signal of military activity was once-secret meeting of military chiefs of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama and the head of the US southern command, four-star Gen. Paul Gorman, on Oct. 1 to lay the groundwork for the revitalization of CONDECA. The chiefs issued a strongly worded declaration endorsing ''the use of force against Marxism . . . to defend democracy and stimulate development in the region.''\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Reactivation of CONDECA is itself interpreted by political observers here as a significant step toward the outbreak of hostilities. Describing CONDECA as something too important to leave to the military, El Tiempo, a leading newspaper here, editorialized: ''The reactivation of CONDECA at this moment, particularly a CONDECA that has endorsed 'the use of force against Marxism,' is tantamount to a declaration of war (against Nicaragua).''\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;In an interview Friday, US Ambassador to Honduras John Negroponte, pictured, maintained that Central American countries, in response to the Sandinistas' military manpower, have the right to take steps to defend themselves. This includes the reactivation of CONDECA, he said.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Mr. Negroponte, who is considered a key architect of Reagan administration policy in the area, said: ''Even though there's a negotiating process going on, until that negotiating process bears fruit the countries can't stop doing the other things they believe necessary to defend themselves. . . .\r\n<br><img src="/mapimages/NegroponteHonduras1984-small.jpg" class="floatright" style="">\r\n&emsp;Honduran Gen. Gustavo Alvarez Martinez has repeatedly described CONDECA as a ''contingency . . . if the Contadora process fails.'' Yet other diplomats and political figures in the region, among them Costa Rican President Luis Alberto Monge, seem to feel less than comfortable with this two-track strategy of preparing for war and peace. President Monge is reported to believe that CONDECA's reactivation would effectively derail the Contadora negotiations.\r\n</i>\r\n<br>\r\n(Nicaraguan rebels hope for US invasion, November 1, 1983, Christian Science Monitor)\r\n</span>\r\n</p>	large	f

190	The Caudillo	1829	1852	arg1	power		<p class="entry columns">\r\n<img src="/mapimages/juanmanuelderosas.jpg" class="floatright">\r\nJuan Manuel de Rosas (1793-1877), who gained fame as a fighter of\r\nIndians and dominated Argentina from 1829 to 1852, exemplified caudillo rule.\r\n\r\nJuan Manuel\r\nde Rosas, a pioneer on the southern frontier, owner of vast estates, lord\r\nof numerous peons, a militia commander who could parley with the\r\nIndians and frighten the politicians, and governor of Buenos Aires from\r\n1829, stood for a policy of expansion and settlement and took a number\r\nof positive steps to improve the security of landholding. He organized\r\nand led the Desert Expedition of 1833 to the Rio Colorado and the Rio\r\nNegro, with the object of containing Indian aggression, expanding the\r\nfrontier and imposing an enduring peace. His policy included diplomacy\r\nas well as force, presents as well as punishment. And it succeeded, adding\r\nto the province of Buenos Aires thousands of square miles, not desert,\r\nbut land watered by great rivers. Rewards were instantaneous. The\r\nprovincial government transferred large tracts of the new land to private\r\nhands in the years following 1833, especially to the senior officers of the\r\nexpeditionary force itself. And as the settlers pushed southwards, they\r\nencroached once more on Indian hunting grounds. But now, in the\r\n1840s, they were viewed by the Indians with more respect, partly because\r\nof the military reputation of Rosas, partly because of the policy of\r\npacification by subsidy.\r\n\r\nlegal structure of landholding. There were three methods of land\r\nacquisition - rent, purchase and grant. Emphyteusis had now outlived its\r\nusefulness. It had facilitated land exploitation (and land concentration),\r\nbut the state had profited hardly at all, for the rent was minimal. Rosas\r\ntherefore decided to sell public land outright and to receive a specific\r\nrevenue when he needed it. Laws of land sale in 1836-8 placed vast tracts\r\nof land on the open market. Most of it obviously went to the wealthy, the\r\npowerful, the favoured; and the names of the large purchasers were\r\nalmost identical with those of the large tenants under emphyteusis, the\r\nAnchorena, Diaz Velez, Alzaga and Arana. By 1840 3,436 square leagues\r\n(20,616,000 acres) of the province were in the possession of 293 people.\r\nYet there was not a rush to buy land, and many would-be purchasers\r\nwere deterred, either by economic recession, as during the French\r\nblockade of 1838-40, or by political insecurity. As an alternative to\r\nselling land, therefore, Rosas gave it away. Generous land grants were\r\nmade to supporters of the regime, to the military who fought its wars or\r\ncrushed its rebels, to bureaucrats and to favourites. Land became almost\r\na currency and sometimes a wages and pensions fund. It was the ultimate\r\nsource of patronage and, when confiscated, a terrible punishment.\r\nBy the 1840s the great plains of Buenos Aires were divided into wellstocked\r\nestancias and supported some 3 million head of cattle, the prime\r\nwealth of the province and the source of an export economy. They were\r\nanimals of inferior grade, raised in the open range under the care of a few\r\nherdsmen; but they yielded hides and salt meat, and that was what the\r\nmarket demanded.\r\nThe estancia had to sell its products in Buenos Aires and beyond, but\r\nthe infrastructure of the province was even more primitive than the\r\nestates which it served. This was a country without roads or bridges, and\r\nwith tracks only on the main routes. Almost everything was done and\r\nsupplied from horseback, and horses were as important a product of the\r\nestancia as cattle. Horses carried gauchos across the plains and armies into\r\nbattle. Fishermen fished in the river on horseback; beggars even begged\r\non horseback. But the chief method of freight transport were bullock\r\ncarts, made in the workshops of Tucuman and led by hard-bitten drivers\r\noperating chiefly along the two high roads which traversed Argentina,\r\none from Buenos Aires through San Luis and Mendoza to Chile, the\r\nother from Buenos Aires via Cordoba, Santiago, Tucuman, Salta and\r\nJujuy to Bolivia. They travelled in trains of some fourteen carts, each\r\ndrawn by six oxen with three spare, moving slowly across pampas and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Rosas was a rancher of the great cattle frontier called the pampa, and frontier militias stiffened his grip on the city of Buenos Aires. He made routine use of violence against his political opponents, but also shrewd use of political imagery and mass propaganda. Rosas had his picture placed on church altars and ordered the people of Buenos Aires to wear red ribbons signifying their support. Anyone caught not wear ing the red ribbon might be beaten in the street. \r\n<br>\r\nIn the mid-1820s there were still some 6,000 slaves left in Buenos\r\nAires. The shortage of labour in the whole region of the Rio de la Plata\r\nencouraged slaveholders to retain as many slaves as they could. A\r\ncertain amount of slave trading as well as slaveholding took place in\r\nArgentina during the 1820s. It was tolerated for a while by the truculent\r\nFederalist caudillo Juan Manuel de Rosas, who ruled Buenos Aires from\r\n1829. Proximity to Brazil and conflicts with the Unitarians in Uruguay\r\ngave opportunities to the Brazilian slave-traders. But Rosas, whose\r\ndictatorship was to last until 1852, did not renounce the Manumission\r\nLaws. Moreover, he made a point of cultivating a following amongst\r\nthe urban blacks, whose fraternities and festivals he patronised. The\r\nnumbers of slaves and libertos steadily declined as a consequence of\r\nmilitary manumission and the working out of the 1813 law. Rosas saw\r\nhis mission as being to re-establish order, discipline and respect for the\r\nlanded proprietors. He was both ruthless and effective in pursuing this\r\ngoal. Slaveholding was eventually limited by the consequent check to\r\nrampant localism and preparedness to enforce legal contracts. Slaveholders\r\nwere at least obliged to respect the letter, if not the spirit, of the\r\nManumission Laws; in Mendoza a surprisingly large number of the few\r\nremaining slaves in 1853 were listed as being forty years old, so that\r\nthey just escaped being libertos.\r\n<br>\r\nIn 1833, a fraction of the federalists rebelled against Rosas and suffered defeat.\r\nThe vanquished, known as the Lomos negros [black backs] were expelled –\r\nturned proscriptos – and went into exile, mostly in Montevideo and some of\r\nthem in Chile. Many others arrived in Chile in the early 1840s, after a series of\r\nother failed attempts to overthrow Rosas.<br>\r\n\r\nRosas represented himself as a man of the people, able to identify with hard-riding gauchos of the pampa and poor black workers in the city while depicting his liberal opponents as effeminate Eurocentric aristocrats, out of touch with the real Argentina. The powerful ranchers of the pampa saw Rosas as one of them, and he protected their interests. For example, the nonsedentary indigenous people of the pampa remained unconquered in the mid-1800s. They had been pushed back by a line of forts, but they often raided herds and ranch houses. Rosas made war on the indigenous people to expand the territory\r\nopen to ranching, but he also negotiated with them skillfully, sometimes in their own language. Finally, Rosas won patriotic glory by defeating British and French interventions in the 1830s\r\nand 1840s.\r\n\r\nHe is overthrown after his defeat at the battle of Caseros. Shortly after the ejection of Rosas, all remaining slaves are freed.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike Brazil or Colombia, both public and private claims to new lands on\r\nthe expanding frontier in the Argentine pampas were made more effective\r\nby an initially unambiguous definition of formal property rights. In the\r\nprovince of Buenos Aires, the process of frontier expansion was in the first\r\ninstance a military operation that preceded settlement. Private settlers did\r\nnot wander out into the frontier in advance of government because of the\r\nthreat of hostile indigenous tribes. Instead, private interests pressured for\r\nmilitary campaigns to pacify the frontier to convert it into grazing land. This\r\nwas the principal reason for the rise of the caudillo dictator, Juan Manuel\r\nde Rosas. Military successes added vast tracts to the public domain, for\r\nwhich formal property rights were quickly defined and transferred to private\r\nhands, either by lease or sale, to raise government revenues and defray\r\nmilitary and other government costs. Like Brazil, population on the frontier\r\nwas sparse so that public lands were privatized in vast tracts. But, unlike\r\nBrazil, formalization of private property rights proceeded with greater regularity\r\nfrom the outset. The credibility of the government to make its claims\r\nto the public domain effective was a function of the public goods it provided\r\nin military services to pacify and defend frontier lands. Despite confiscations\r\nby Rosas that were nullified later, most property rights in land were\r\nwell defined. Over time, this facilitated development of active land and\r\nmortgage markets. Mortgage credit, in turn, was instrumental in, though\r\nnot solely responsible for, the extraordinary expansion of the Argentine\r\neconomy during its belle ´epoque of export-led growth prior toWorldWar I.	large	t

Adventurers and fortune hunters poured in. Brazil had 300,000 inhabitants in 1700; a century later, at the end of the gold years, the population had multiplied eleven times. No less than 300,000 Portuguese emigrated to Brazil in the eighteenth century, a larger contingent than Spain contributed to all its Latin American colonies. From the conquest of Brazil until abolition, it is estimated that some 10 million blacks were brought from Africa; there are no precise figures for the eighteenth century, but the gold cycle absorbed slave labor in prodigious quantities.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Salvador de Bahia was the Brazilian capital of the prosperous Northeastern sugar cycle, but the &quot;golden age&quot; in Minas Gerais moved the country's economic and political capital southward and Rio de Janeiro, the region's port, became the new capital in 1763. In the dynamic heart of the new mining economy, camps bloomed abruptly into cities, described by a contemporary colonial authority as &quot;sanctuaries for criminals, vagabonds, and malefactors,&quot; in a vertigo of easy riches. The &quot;Vila Rica de Ouro Preto&quot; (The &quot;Rich Town of Black Gold,&quot; so called because the mined gold turned black on exposure to the humid air, due to the presence of silver. -Trans.) had grown to city size by 1711; born of the miners' avalanche, it was the quintessence of the gold civilization. Simao Ferreira Machado, describing it twenty-three years later, said that the power of Ouro Preto businessmen surpassed by far that of Lisbon's most flourishing merchants: &quot;Hither, as to a port, are directed and collected in the Royal Mint the grandiose amounts of gold from all the Mines. Here dwell the best educated men, both lay and ecclesiastic. Here is the seat of all the nobility and the strength of the military. It is, by virtue of its natural position, the head of the whole of America; and by the wealth of its riches, it is the precious pearl of Brazil.&quot; Another writer of the period, Francisco Tavares de Brito, in 1732 defined Ouro Preto as &quot;the Potosi of gold.&quot;</p>	large	f
496	To Carry Out Murder	2003	2003	col1	power		<p class="entry "><img src="/mapimages/soawhisc.jpg" class="floatright">&quot;According to journalist Grace Livingstone, as of 2003 more Colombian School of the Americas graduates have been identified as alleged human rights abusers than SOA graduates from any other Latin American country.&quot;\r\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) concluded that the resulting military intelligence networks, organized and operating according to the US suggestions incorporated by <strong>Order 200-05/91</strong>, subsequently laid the groundwork for continuing an illegal, covert partnership between the military and paramilitaries. HRW argued that the restructuring process solidified linkages between members of the Colombian military and civilian members of paramilitary groups, by incorporating them into several of the local intelligence networks and by cooperating with their activities. In effect, HRW believed that this further consolidated &quot;<i>a secret network that relied on paramilitaries not only for intelligence, but to carry out murder</i>&quot;. Human Rights Watch argued that this situation allowed the Colombian government and military to plausibly deny links or responsibility for paramilitary human rights abuses. HRW stated that, far from diminishing violence, the military intelligence networks created by the U.S. reorganization appeared to have dramatically increased violence, citing massacres in Barrancabermeja as an example.&quot; </p>\r\n<p class="caption"><i>Pictured</i>, The School of Americas, cynically renamed Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation at Fort Benning, Georgia</p>	large	f

He was arrested on December 16, 1975, which was around the time the mmilitary began in earnest to turn its attentions to the Communist Party, of which he was a member. (The Uruguayan Communist Party had previously enjoyed a long history as a distinguished, if marginal, participant in the country's democratic politics.) Dr. Mandressi was initially taken to an abandoned factory, behind the barracks of a mechanized-cavalry regiment that had been nicknamed El Infierno by its guests. "All of us were hooded all the time," he recalled. "And all of on were tortured for days on end, without even being interrogated at first. There must have been a hundred and fifty, two hundred people therm you could hear breathing, coughing, moaning—we weren't allowed to talk to each other. Occasionally your hood would slip a bit, but you could still see nothing. It was pitch-black. At one point, they kept us standing, our hands tied behind our backs, for four full days. One almost loses all sense of time in such situations, but four times I heard the birds outside chirping with the rising sun—that's how I know it was four days. Eventually, they'd take us in for their interrogations—beatings, shocks, <i>submarino</i> immersions. They weren't really after any information—they knew everything already, had everybody's name. It was all just part of the process. Once, I became aware that a seven-year-old boy had been brought in and was being forced to witness his parents' being tortured. I know I wasn't hallucinating—at the time, I thought I was—because I checked with others later, and they had all had the same hallucination." <strong> (A Miracle, A Universe by Lawrence Weschler)</strong>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<i>\r\nSubmarino consists of dunking a victim’s head into a vat filled with water, to which urine, excrement or other contaminants may have been added to increase the torment. This leads to a ‘‘near-drowning’’ experience in which victims are suffocated by having to hold their breath under water or inhaling the water, and which has been described as one of the most traumatic a human being can endure.  The physical consequences of submarino are usually short-lived, consisting mainly of uncontrollable coughing from the inhaled ‘‘water’’, but it can also cause acute brain damage due to deprivation of oxygen, as well as death from asphyxiation. The acute suffering produced during the immediate infliction of submarino is superseded by the often unbearable fear of repeating the experience.</i> <strong>(The International Committee of the Red Cross)</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Investigations"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="background:black;color:#FFFFFF;padding:15px;position:relative;top:350px">\r\nAn unknown number were disappeared and after the fall of the military dictatorship in 1985, amnesty was granted (including making it illegal to investigate the crimes of the state).

326	The U.S. Builds the Paramilitary Apparatus	1963	1980	inels4	power	Turning the Tide, Noam Chomsky	<p class="entry columns">The Alliance for Progress programs of strengthening internal security forces took a still more ominous turn in El Salvador, with the establishment of the military and paramilitary apparatus that was to be responsible for widespread slaughter in coming years. According to Allan Nairn's detailed study (<A href="http://historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/nairnelsalvadorbtds.html" class="inline" target="_blank">Behind The Death Squads</a>), the US organized and trained the rural paramilitary force ORDEN, which has terrorized the countryside since, as well as the elite presidential intelligence service ANSESAL, which served as the intelligence arm of the &quot;death squads.&quot; The founder of ORDEN and ANSESAL, General Medrano, was enlisted as a CIA agent. Described by Jose Napoleon Duarte as &quot;the father of the Death Squads, the chief assassin of them all,&quot; he was awarded a silver medal by President Johnson &quot;in recognition of exceptionally meritorious service.&quot; Medrano stated that &quot;ORDEN and ANSESAL grew out of the State Department, the CIA, and the Green Berets during the time of Kennedy.&quot; Parallel domestic security agencies were established in Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, Honduras and Costa Rica and &quot;would meet every three months under the supervision of the State Department and exchange information and methods of operation,&quot; Medrano added.

By the time Delano had dressed and come topside the "strange ship," as he later described it, had slackened its sails and was now drifting with the wind toward an underwater ledge. To his puzzlement, it flew no flag. It looked to be in want and, if it drew closer to the shallows, in danger. Delano hastily had water, pumpkins, and fresh fish loaded in a boat. He then ordered it hoisted down and went on board.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe weather that morning was thick and breezy but the sun rose to reveal a calm bay. The other side of the island, from where the mysterious ship had appeared, was rough. Endless breakers, sharp-toothed underwater reefs, and steep rock-faced cliffs made its coastline unapproachable, providing sanctuaries for the seals that elsewhere had been hunted to near extinction. But the island's east, where the Perseverance harbored, was peaceful, the Southern Hemisphere's waning summer offering a harmony of lulling earth tones, brown, rich dirt, green sea, and cloudless blue skies. High bluffs blanketed by wild red thistles shielded a sandy, safe haven used by sealers and whalers to socialize, pass mailbags to ships bound home, and replenish wood and water.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAs he came closer, Delano could see the ship's name, the Tryal, painted in English in faded white letters along its bow. He could also see that its deck was full of black-skinned people, who looked to be slaves. And when he climbed on board, the alabaster-skinned New Englander discovered himself surrounded by scores of Africans and a handful of Spanish and mulatto sailors telling their "stories" and sharing their "grievances" in a babel of languages.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThey spoke in Wolof, Mandinka, Fulani, and Spanish, a rush of words indecipherable in its details but soothing to Delano in its generalities. Earlier, as his men rowed toward the ship, he could see that its sails were tattered. What should have been an orderly web of rigging and tackle was a wooly mash. Its hull, calcified, moss covered, and pulling a long trail of sea grass, gave off a greenish tint. But he knew it was a common pirates' ploy to make ships appear distressed in order to lure victims on board. Napoleon had just crowned himself emperor of the French, Madrid and Paris were at war with London, and privateers were raiding merchant ships at will, even in the distant South Pacific. Now, though, hollow cheeks and frantic eyes confirmed that the misery was real, turning Delano's fears into "feelings of pity."\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAmasa Delano was on board the Tryal for about nine hours, from around seven in the morning to a little after four in the afternoon. Having sent his away team back to the island to fill the Tryal's casks with water, he spent most of the day alone among its voyagers, talking with its captain, helping to distribute the food and water he had brought with him, and securing the ship so it didn't drift. Delano, a distant cousin of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, from a respected shipbuilding and fishing family on the Massachusetts coast, was an experienced mariner in the middle of his third sail around the world. Yet he couldn't see that it was the Tryal's slaves, and not the man who introduced himself as its master, who were in command.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Perserverance"></div>\r\n<p class="entry columns" style="background-image:url('/mapimages/oldpaper.jpg');position: relative; top: 85px; padding: 6px;">\r\n\r\n&emsp;\r\nLed by an older man named Babo and his son Mori, the West Africans had seized control of the Tryal nearly two months earlier and executed most of its crew and passengers, along with the slave trader who was taking them to Lima. They then ordered Benito Cerreno, the vessel's owner and captain, to sail them to Senegal. Cerreno stalled, afraid of rounding Cape Horn with only a handful of sailors and a ship full of mutinous slaves. He cruised first up and then down the Chilean coast, before running into Delano's Perseverance. The slaves could have fought or fled. Instead, Babo came up with a plan. The West Africans let Delano come on board and they acted as if they were still slaves. Mori stayed at Cerreno's side and feigned to be a humble and devoted servant. Cerreno pretended he was still in charge, making up a story about storms, doldrums, and fevers to account for the state of his ship and the absence of any officer besides himself.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nDelano didn't know what to make of Cerreno. He remained uneasy around him, even after he had convinced himself that he wasn't a brigand. Delano mistook Cerreno's vacant stare — the effect of hunger and thirst and of having lived for almost two months under a death threat, after having witnessed most of his crew being executed — for disdain, as if the aristocratic-looking Spaniard, dressed in a velvet jacket and loosely fitting black pants, thought himself too good to converse with a pea-coated New Englander. The West Africans, especially the women, also made Delano uncomfortable, though he couldn't say why. There were nearly thirty females on board, among them older women, young girls, and about nine mothers with suckling infants. Once the food and water had been doled out, the women took their babies and gathered together in the stern, where they began to sing a slow dirge to a tune Delano didn't recognize. Nor did he understand the words, though the song had the opposite effect on him than did the soothing mix of languages that had welcomed his arrival.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThen there was Cerreno's servant, Mori, who never left his master's side. When the two captains went below deck, Mori followed. When Delano asked Cerreno to send the slave away so they could have a word alone, the Spaniard refused. The West African was his "confidant" and "companion," he insisted, and Delano could speak freely in front of him. Mori was, Cerreno said, "captain of the slaves." At first, Delano was amused by the attentiveness Mori paid to his master's needs. He started, though, to resent him, vaguely blaming the black man for the unease he had felt toward Cerreno. Delano became fixated on the slave. Mori, he later wrote, "excited my wonder." Other West Africans, including Mori's father, Babo, were also always around, "always listening." They seemed to anticipate Delano's thoughts, hovering around him like a school of pilot fish, moving him first this way, then that. "They all looked up to me as a benefactor," Delano wrote in his memoir, A Narrative of Voyages and Travels in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, published in 1817, still, twelve years after the fact, confusing how he thought the rebels saw him that day with how they actually did see him.\r\n<br>&emsp;<i>After returning to the Perseverance, Delano orders an attack on the Tryal. After a pitched battle lasting hours, in which several of the slaves were captured, chained, tortured and killed (including Babo), the two ships are brought to the town of Talcahuano, where eleven of the ringleaders are brought to trial in in the inland town of conception. All will be found guilty, nine will be executed. </i>\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nYears later, a British consul in Concepcion, Henry William Rouse, recounted a story he heard when he first arrived in town: just before the trapdoor sprung and Mori's body fell through, the West African finally spoke. He damned the "cruel inhumanity of his captors, who, in the complete absence of the law steal men out of their homes."\r\n<br>&emsp; The corpses of the nine rebels were cut loose from the gallows and decapitated. Their heads were placed on pikes around the plaza and their bodies burned in a large pyre in its center. \r\n</p>	large	f

875	Pisagua	1927	1952	chi1	power	The General’s Slow Retreat: Chile after Pinochet  By Mary Helen Spoone	<p class="entry columns" style="background-color:white;padding:9px;position:relative;top:350px;">\r\n&emsp;The town of Pisagua is located on a lonely stretch of Chile's northernmost coast and can be visited only after a white-knuckle ride down a cliff road that in places seems to descend almost vertically. It was once an important port during the country's nineteenth-century nitrate boom, with a theater and a railway connecting it to the larger port of Iquique, seventy-five miles south. But after the nitrate industry's collapse, Pisagua, which in Spanish means <i>piss</i> and <i>water</i>, acquired a reputation as awful as its name. The town's remote location made it an ideal site for a penal colony, which would be opened and then abandoned several times during the twentieth century. And any prisoner foolhardy enough to attempt escape on foot would have faced almost certain death. The town borders the Atacama Desert, which is the driest place on earth. A few hundred people still live in the area, eking out a living by fishing, but most of Pisagua's buildings are abandoned.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Pisagua was used by the military regime of General Carlos Ibanez (1927-31) as a detention center for male homosexuals. Chile's first cold war president, Gabriel Gonzalez Vide la (1946-52), also utilized Pisagua as a prison during his brutal crackdown on the Chilean Communist Party. And Pinochet, who had been stationed and trained at the camp as a young army officer in the 1940s and then as a brigadier general in the late 1960s, made a similar use of Pisagua during his regime.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;On June 3, 1990 officials discovered an unmarked grave, <i>pictured</i>, containing the bodies of five prisoners. The site, near the Pisagua cemetery, had belonged to the Chilean army until recently. Those who buried the dead men had added lime to the soil in an effort to speed up the decomposition, but the dry, saline soil had practically mummified their bodies, preserving their clothes, bonds, blindfolds, and bullet wounds-an undeniable record of what had taken place.\r\n</p>	large	f

Sebastian Acevedo, a coal miner, had\r\nset himself on fire on that spot, after fruitless\r\nefforts to find somebody to intercede for him at the National\r\nCenter for Information to stop the torture of his\r\ntwenty-two-year-old son and twenty-year-old daughter who\r\nhad been arrested for illegal possession of arms.\r\n<br>&emsp; Sebastian Acevedo did not plead, but he gave warning.\r\nThe archbishop was away on a trip, so he spoke to officers\r\nof the archbishopric, to reporters of the leading newspapers,\r\nto the heads of political parties, to leaders of business and\r\nindustry, to anyone who would listen, even to government\r\nofficials, saying the same thing to everyone: <font style="color:#cc0000">"If you don't do\r\nsomething to stop the torture of my children, I will soak\r\nmyself with gasoline and set myself on fire in the atrium of\r\nthe cathedral."</font> Some did not believe him. Others did not\r\nknow what to do. Sebastian Acevedo stood in the atrium on\r\nthe appointed day, emptied a pail full of gasoline over his\r\nbody, and warned the crowd gathered in the street that if\r\nanyone crossed the yellow line he would immediately set\r\nhimself on fire. A carabinero, in an effort to stop the immolation,\r\nstepped over the line, and Sebastian Acevedo became\r\na human bonfire.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;He lived for seven hours, lucid and suffering no pain. The\r\npublic outcry was so great that the police were obliged to\r\nallow his daughter to visit him in the hospital before he died.\r\nBut the doctors did not want her to see him in such a horrible\r\ncondition and would allow her to talk to him only on an\r\nintercom. "How do I know you are Candelaria?" Sebastian\r\nAcevedo asked when he heard her voice. She told him the\r\npet name he used to call her when she was little. The brother\r\nand sister were released from the torture chambers, as the\r\nmartyred father had demanded in giving his life for theirs,\r\nand they were placed under the jurisdiction of the regular\r\ncourts. Since that time, the people of Concepción have had\r\na secret name for the place of sacrifice: Plaza Sebastian Acevedo.\r\n</p>	large	f

Headed by Cardinal Silva Henriquez and supported by all who fight for the return of democracy to Chile, it has\r\na moral influence difficult to counteract. The persecuted of all persuasions find refuge and human solidarity in the broad,\r\nsunny courtyard of its colonial building. The Vicariate is a reliable source of aid for those in need, particularly political prisoners and their families. Through it, cases of torture are denounced and campaigns are launched on behalf of the desaparecidos and against injustice of all kinds.\r\n<br>&emsp; [In 1985], threats by the dictatorship against the Vicariate had backfired. At the end of February 1985, three opposition militants were kidnapped with such a show of force that there could be no doubt who\r\nwas responsible. The sociologist Jose Manuel Parada, an officer\r\nof the Vicariate, was taken into custody in front of his\r\nchildren outside their school, with the traffic blocked off for\r\nthree blocks and the entire sector patrolled by army helicopters.\r\nThe other two activists were picked up in different parts\r\nof the city a few hours apart. One was Manuel Guerrero,\r\nhead of the Teachers' Union Association of Chile, and the\r\nother was Santiago Nattino, a distinguished graphic artist\r\nwho had not been known as a political militant before. To\r\nthe nation's horror, the bodies of these three men were found\r\non March 2, 1985, on a lonely road near the international\r\nairport, their throats cut and their bodies bearing the signs\r\nof torture. General Cesar Mendoza Duran, commander of\r\nthe police and a member of the junta, made a statement to\r\nthe press declaring that the triple crime was the result of\r\nfighting between communist factions controlled by Moscow.\r\nBut many believed General Mendoza Duran himself was the\r\nperpetrator, and he was forced to resign from the government.\r\nSince then the name of Calle Puente,one of the four\r\nstreets leading to the Plaza de Armas, was erased by an unknown\r\nhand and replaced with that of Jose Manuel Parada,\r\nthe name by which it is now known.	large	f

The Dominican terror resembles the current wave of political killings in Guatemala...in that the paramilitary death squads are organized by the armed forces and police, which in both cases over the years have been given heavy U.S. material and advisory support. The Wall Street Journal reported on September 9, 1971 that &quot;the conservative Catholic Church hierarchy has condemned the 'institutionalization' of terror.&quot; The Journal also claimed that the opinion was widespread in the Dominican Republic that the United States was behind the paramilitary death squads.

The hungry were hit by the same European diseases which had caused so much harm in the Caribbean. The effect was even greater than that of the Black Death on 14th century Europe.

In the two months after Mitch struck, with the country still knee-deep in rubble, corpses and mud, the Honduran congress initiated what the Financial Times called “speed sell-offs after the storm.” It passed laws allowing the privatization of airports, seaports and highways and fast-tracked plans to privatize the state telephone company, the national electric company and parts of the water sector. It overturned land-reform laws and made it easier for foreigners to buy and sell property. It was much the same in neighboring countries: In the same two months, Guatemala announced plans to sell off its phone system, and Nicaragua did likewise, along with its electric company and its petroleum sector.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;All of the privatization plans were pushed aggressively by the usual suspects.

In the port itself, other worker's associations which had caused work stoppage joined the movement.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Eduardo Galeano writes of this episode: <i>José Briggs, leader of the strike, is the son of a North American, but refuses to seek protection from the U.S. consul. The consul of Peru tries to save the Peruvian workers, but they won’t abandon their Chilean comrades. The consul of Bolivia tries to lure away the Bolivian workers. The Bolivian workers say: “With the Chileans we live, and with the Chileans we die.”</i>\r\n<br>&emsp; A state of siege was declared in the zone, and the government sent General Roberto Silva Renard to take command of the situation. On December 21st, the Chilean military arrived and gave the strikers an hour to leave. When they refused, the soldiers opened fire over the Escuela Santa Maria, killing what is believed were two thousand of the mineworkers, their wives and their children. This event constituted a hard blow for the northern workers and the <i>mancomunal</i> [labor brotherhood] movement.\r\n<br> <i>&emsp;This picture was taken moments before the massacre</i>\r\n</p>	large	f

This victory\r\ndirectly prepared the ground for the momentous conflict which ensued\r\nbetween the metropolis and the mainland colonies. During the wars\r\nlarge concessions had been made to the colonial assemblies. Efforts had\r\nbeen made to bring together the formerly localistic and fragmented\r\ncolonies in a common military effort. The defeat and disappearance of\r\nFrench power in mainland North America removed a powerful\r\nincentive to colonial subordination. The heady rhetoric of ‘patriotism’\r\nhad stimulated both colonial confidence and imperial assertiveness.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;The slaves of the Americas in 1770 were more intensively exploited\r\nthan any group of this size in history. Yet the immediate threat to\r\nempire came not from the exploited but from a colonial alliance\r\nincluding many of the exploiters. While imperial garrisons and\r\nsquadrons were sometimes available to subjugate slave revolts and\r\ncontain maroons the planters preferred to stamp out resistance by means\r\nof their own patrols and militia. Metropolitan forces had the primary\r\nfunction of protecting colonies from external attack. It is for this reason\r\nthat the British victory in North America in 1763 was too sweeping for\r\nits own good; it emancipated the colonists from their fear of the French\r\nand Spanish.\r\n</p>	large	f

General Alvarez, who according to Newsweek, &quot;doesn't care if officers are thieves, as long as they are virulent anti-communists,&quot; assisted in training programs and founded a special &quot;hit squad,&quot; the Cobras.

Described as “the cruelest of tyrants,” by his contemporary\r\nFriar Bartolomé de Las Casas, Pedrarias set a\r\nstandard of conflict and tyranny that was too often repeated in Central\r\nAmerica for years to come.

Unable to afford the new bus fares and facing serious difficulties in making it to their jobs in the second half of the month, commuters from outlying areas around Caracas were the first to erupt in anger, followed by thousands of people in slum neighbourhoods, vandals, and even police officers themselves. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe rioting and subsequent crackdown lasted a week. The clampdown on the protesters and looters was harsh after Tuesday the 28th, as the military was called out on the streets in several major cities and a curfew was set—measures that had not been used in Venezuela in several generations.  With the police and National Guard unable to restore order, Perez called out the army on the night of Monday, Feb. 27, and the troops brutally cracked down on the rioters, who were acting without clear objectives or political leadership of any kind. It is true as well, as journalists witnessed at the time, that the army also attempted on a number of occasions to at least impose order among the chaos, having looters stand in organised lines that filed in and out of supermarkets and stores, and ensuring that they only took food and did not cause damages. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n&quot;It was the first breakdown of the institutional pact under which democracy had functioned since 1958, a kind of collective decision to break with the prevailing state of law. But it was also a great national failure, a fight without winners, which remains a huge open wound,&quot; said sociologist Tulio Hernandez. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n The end result: hundreds of people killed, around 2,000 injured and more than 150 million dollars in damages to shops and businesses. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOn the 28th, Andres Perez suspended a number of constitutional civil liberties as the country had been effectively shut down within two days. The protests continued, and the military were sent in. Between 275 and 3,000 were killed, mostly civilians killed by the military and mercenaries.</p>	large	f

Like prior immigration laws, it increased funding for border control as well internal enforce-ment activities. However, it also contained provisions that reinforced the immigration-related antiterrorism measures in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (A EDPA). It expedited removals of unauthorized migrants and increased the bar on reentry as well as limiting legal options for noncitizens charged with an immigration violation. It expanded the range of offenses that count as aggravated felonies for immigration/deportation purposes and made a number of immigration offenses prosecutable under the federal a ntiracketeering act (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations [RICO]), inaugurating a new point of intersection for immigration enforcement and federal law enforcement ef-forts. IIRAIRA expanded the grounds for exclusion for legal immigrants deemed to be a public charge, reinforcing the signals cent by the immigrant welfare re-strictions contained in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Recon-ciliation Act of 1996. It also gave immigration officers a greater degree of discretion in barring the entry of noncitizens and authorized memorandums of agreement allowing state law enforcement to partner with federal agencies in immigration enforcement, The latter introduced a legal precedent that supports present-day lo-cal enforcement practices, and the act in general promotes more rigorous and re-strictive admissions criteria for asylum seekers and noncitizens entering with temporary visas—primarily students and professional workers. </p>	large	t

He runs on a platform that seems to both assure economic elites that he is willing to bargain, while telling audiences internationally: "Where we are in power, we turn neo-liberalism on its head. That’s our starting point. We start from the needs of the people, not the needs of capital.”\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entries columns3" style="background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:9px;position:relative;top:230px;">\r\n<strong>The Corruption Issue...</strong><br>\r\n\r\n&emsp;\r\nHis party,  the PT (<i>Partido dos Trabalhadores</i> or <i>Worker's Party</i>) got less than a fifth of the seats in Congress, where allies had to be found for the government to command a legislative majority. The head of Lula's cabinet had wanted to make a deal with the largest party of the centre, the PMDB (the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party), but this would have meant conceding important ministries. Lula preferred to stitch together a patchwork of smaller parties, whose bargaining power was weaker. But they naturally expected a share of the spoils too, if a lower grade one, and so the mensalão – the monthly backhander – was devised for them.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn cash terms, the corruption from which the PT benefited, and over which it presided, was probably more systematic than that of any predecessor. In absolute terms, Brazilian elections are second only to America’s in their costs, and relative to national income can exceed them by a wide margin. In 1996, Clinton spent $43 million to take the White House; in 1994 Cardoso laid out $41 million to secure the Palácio do Planalto, in a country with a per capita GDP less than a sixth that of the US. Unlike Cardoso, who twice sailed to victory on the first ballot as the establishment candidate, and commanded abundant natural – in Brazilian parlance, ‘physiological’ – allies and placemen in Congress, Lula was a three-time loser when he ran again for the presidency in early 2002, and his party traditionally an object of the deepest suspicion to all who counted economically in the country. To mount that unfavorable gradient, special resources were needed, for which special undertakings had to be given, public and private. So too, with a smaller core of deputies and fewer spontaneous friends in the legislature, to obtain makeshift majorities in Congress the PT was driven to bribe on a bigger scale.\r\n</p>	large	f

One year after Videla's coup, Amnesty International estimated 15,000 people had disappeared and many were in secret detention camps, but although the U.S. press admitted human rights abuses occurred in Argentina, Videla was often described as a &quot;moderate&quot; who revitalized his nation's troubled economy. \r\n<br>&emsp;Videla had a good public relations firm in the U.S., Deaver and Hannaford, the same firm used by Ronald Reagan, Taiwan, and Guatemala. Not surprisingly, his Economics Minister, Jose Martinez de Hoz, spoke, at Deaver's request, on one of President Reagan's national broadcasts in order to upgrade Argentina's reputation. Videla also received aid from WACL, the World Anti-Communist League, through its affiliate, CAL (Confederation Anticomunista Latinoamericana).<br>\r\nCAL sent millions of dollars to Argentina from sources such as the Italo-Argentine Masonic Lodge P-2, an outgrowth of old U.S. anti-communist alliances with the Italian drug mafia. As part of its WACL affiliation, Argentina trained Nicaraguan contras for the U.S. Videla left office in 1981, and after the Falklands Crisis of 1982 he and his cohorts were tried for human rights abuses by the new government.\r\n<br>&emsp;During the Process of National Reorganization—the military junta’s grandiose name for the period of its rule, from 1976 to 1983—as many as thirty thousand people, mostly young Argentines, were disappeared. The government justified its tactics as part of a war against a revolutionary insurrection waged by “subversive terrorists,” though the junta’s first leader, General Jorge Rafael Videla, defined a “terrorist” as “not only someone who plants bombs but a person whose ideas are contrary to Western, Christian civilization.” \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style="background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:9px;position:relative;top: 218px;left: 430px;width: 511px;font-size: .8em;"> &emsp;*"According to General Videla, a war had to be fought to destroy 'Godless communists' who threatened the security of the state. As in Guatemala, the definition of those who constituted this threat was inflated by the military: as Videla put it, 'a terrorist is not just someone with a gun or a bomb, but also someone who spreads ideas that are contrary to Western and Christian civilisation'. Elizabeth Jelin and Susana Kaufman argue that, used in these circumstances, the term 'war' is a misnomer. They concede that a leftist guerrilla movement was indeed engaged in 'widespread armed conflict' with right-wing paramilitary death-squads during the early 1970s; and that this conflict, together with the violence unleashed by the state before, during and after the coup, has been `defined by some as ... a "Dirty War" '. However, to use this name implies a particular interpretation - that 'both sides' shared responsibility for the violence - with which they are in disagreement. Argentina, they maintain, did not undergo a war, but a process of 'State Terrorism' undertaken by 'a state apparatus that resorted systematically to terror and repression of citizens and civil institutions without any respect for existing national and international juridical norms'.

Sixty students from Manuel Belgrano High School, in Buenos Aires, were disappeared simply for having joined their student council. Victims were abducted as they stepped off buses, as they walked home from work or school, or in midnight raids of private residences and of the safe houses where members of guerrilla groups or of banned trade and student organizations lived in hiding. The abductees were taken to clandestine detention centers, where the majority of them were tortured and killed. \r\n<br>&emsp;Approximately thirty per cent of the disappeared were women. Some were abducted with their small children, and some, perhaps three per cent, were pregnant, or became so while in detention, usually through rape by guards and torturers. Pregnant prisoners were routinely kept alive until they’d given birth. “The regime’s depravity reached its outer limit with pregnant detainees,” Marguerite Feitlowitz, then a Harvard professor, wrote in her groundbreaking study of the Argentine nightmare, “Lexicon of Terror.” One former detainee told Feitlowitz, “Our bodies were a source of special fascination. They said my swollen nipples invited the ‘prod’ ”—the electric cattle prod, which was used in torture. “They presented a truly sickening combination—the curiosity of little boys, the intense arousal of twisted men.” \r\n<br>&emsp;Sometimes the mothers were able to nurse their newborns, at least sporadically, for a few days, or even weeks, before the babies were taken from them and the mothers were “transferred”—sent to their deaths, in the Dirty War’s notorious nomenclature. A common method of “transfer” was to inject the women with drugs and shove them from planes into the River Plate or the Atlantic. According to human-rights groups, as many as five hundred newborns and young children were taken from disappeared parents and handed over, their identities erased, to childless military and police couples and others favored by the regime.\r\n</p>	large	f
223	Colonization	1900	1900	pue1	culture		<p class="entry columns">\r\n&emsp;After its military occupation of 1898, the U.S. Government imposes the Foraker act on the people of Puerto Rico, officially turning the nation into a U.S. Colony. The Foraker Act of 1900 created the office of governor, vested with absolute power and appointed by the president of the\r\nUnited States, assisted by an executive council at least five of whom had to be native inhabitants of the island, with the remaining six open to American appointees.\r\nThere would be an elected, thirty-five-member House of\r\nDelegates, but its decisions were subject to veto by either the governor or Congress. The only Puerto Rican who testified at a congressional\r\nhearing on the act was Julio Henna, a veteran civil rights campaigner.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n<font style="color:#cc0000">"No liberty, no rights, no protection,"</font> Henna said in an eloquent\r\nsummary of its provisions. <font style="color:#cc0000">"We are Mr. Nobody from Nowhere."</font>\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe Act also limits land holdings to no more than 500\r\nacres but this provision is ignored.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:.88em;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;position:relative;left:-10px;width:1000px;">\r\n<strong>Learning to Obey</strong><br>\r\n&emsp;In the words of Charles Eliot, president\r\nof Harvard University at the time of the 1898 colonial war, “I am inclined to the\r\nbelief that we shall be able to do Cuba and Porto Rico some good; though to do\r\nso we shall have to better very much our previous and existing practices in dealing\r\nwith inferior peoples.”\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nNotwithstanding these sentiments, to some Puerto Ricans the new colonial\r\npower offered possibilities for social justice and a democratic political system\r\nunimaginable under Spain. These people regarded the 1898 invasion with optimism.\r\nTheir idealization of the United States, however, would not be borne out.\r\nAfter nineteen months of military rule, on May 1, 1900, under the Foraker Act, the\r\noccupation forces a highly centralized civilian government under the\r\ndirect control of the U.S. federal government. With the exception of a brief period with local school boards, the educational system would become a similarly centralized structure led by a commissioner of education appointed by the president\r\nof the United States until 1948.\r\nThe authority of the commissioner extended to the\r\nNormal School, established in 1900, and the University of Puerto Rico, founded in\r\n1903. Thus, contrary to its tradition of decentralized governance, the U.S. state\r\ncoming out of the 1898 war opted instead to govern its new colonies in the centralized\r\nmanner in which it governed the affairs of its Native American societies.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn the wake of its military victory in 1898, the U.S. government initiated what\r\nthe dominant discourse called a “civilizing,” “Americanizing,” or “assimilationist”\r\nmission. A crucial step in this mission was to grind down or “pulverize” the constituent\r\nelements of the conquered peoples’ cultural identities. In 1902 Samuel\r\nMcCune Lindsay, the commissioner of education of Puerto Rico, noted, “Colonization\r\ncarried forward by the armies of war is vastly more costly than that carried\r\nforward by the armies of peace, whose outpost and garrisons are the public\r\nschools of the advancing nation.”\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nThe process of reacculturation went hand in hand with the steps taken to\r\ndestroy the cultural identity of the conquered peoples. The Puerto Rican poet\r\nand political activist Juan Antonio Corretjer (1908–89) described those who were\r\nsubjected to the educational policies and practices of the early years of occupation\r\nand conquest as “the most tortured generation.” To this end, the United\r\nStates established a public system of “American” schools and an “American” curriculum\r\nin Puerto Rico in 1898, which included the stated goal of having English\r\nas the primary language of teaching and learning, a policy that lasted until 1948.\r\nA year later, in 1899, the colonial government established a series of scholarships\r\nfor vocational and university study in the United States. In 1900 a Normal\r\nSchool for teacher education was founded, following the model already in use\r\nin the United States for the education of Indians and African Americans. On\r\nMarch 12, 1903, the United States founded the University of Puerto Rico, in which\r\nEnglish was the official language of instruction until 1942.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n<img src="/mapimages/puertoricocaguasschool.jpg" class="floatleft" style="max-width:70%;">\r\nTeacher training became one of the main priorities of government officials in\r\nWashington and San Juan in this period. One hundred and twenty English teachers\r\nfrom the United States were sent to Puerto Rico to assist in the establishment\r\nof English as the language of instruction on the island. The Department of Education\r\norganized summer institutes for the education of teachers following the\r\nmodel used for similar programs at the Hampton Institute in Virginia and the\r\nTuskegee Normal and Industrial School in Alabama. In addition, as it did in 1900,\r\nwhen 1,273 public school teachers from Cuba were sent to Harvard University for\r\na summer of training in the English language and for the study of educational\r\ntheories and practices, 540 public school teachers from Puerto Rico were sent to\r\nHarvard and Cornell University in 1904 to participate in a similar summer program.\r\nThe magnitude of the summer programs at Harvard and Cornell in 1900\r\nand 1904 is evidenced by the fact that 1,273 teachers in 1900 represented more\r\nthan 40 percent of the Cuban teaching corps and the 540 Puerto Rican teachers\r\nrepresented 47 percent of the teachers in service in 1904.\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The picture, from roughly 1900, is captioned "America's greatest gift to Porto Rico - the public school, Caguas"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class="entry_source">The Imperial Enterprise and Educational Policies in Colonial\r\nPuerto Rico by pablo navarro-rivera</span>\r\n</p>	large	f

Thus, after having reported to Congress that the &ldquo;wetback problem&rdquo; had never been so bad, Brownell recommended that there be no increase in the Border Patrol's budget, and that there be a reduction in the INS's overall budget, suggesting that it was premature to deport &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; workers. Nevertheless, in the face of growing pressure, the Eisenhower administration demonstrated some commitment to fighting unregulated immigration by announcing the start of its infamous Operation Wetback on June 9, 1954.\r\n<br>&emsp; Led by INS Commissioner General Joseph Swing, the operation involved the massive roundup of suspected &ldquo;wetbacks&rdquo; in border states.

Although Operation Wetback resulted in a record number of deportations, the U.S. government compensated agricultural interests by greatly increasing the number of braceros admitted into the United States. In this regard, the operation&rsquo;s most important outcome was to increase state and grower control over migrant labor.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</td></tr></table>\r\n</div>	large	f

Álvarez was a fierce anti-Communist who detested the Sandinista movement that had recently come to power in neighboring Nicaragua. When the Reagan administration asked him to turn Honduras into a base for anti-Sandinista rebels, known as contras, he eagerly agreed. Soon hundreds of contras were operating from camps along the Nicaraguan border, and thousands of American soldiers were flying in and out of the ballooning Aguacate air base nearby. From 1980 to 1984, annual United States military aid to Honduras increased from $4 million to $77 million. Once again, it had surrendered its national sovereignty to Americans. \r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;Rivals forced General Alvarez from power in 1984 but did not dismantle his repressive machine. It had two purposes: supporting the contras and repressing dissent within Honduras. To achieve this latter goal, the army established a secret squad called Battalion 3-16, trained and supported by the CIA, that maintained clandestine torture chambers and carried out kidnappings and killings. The most powerful figure in the country during this period was the American ambassador, John Negroponte, who studiously ignored all pleas that he try to curb the regime's excesses. \r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;<font style="color:#cc0000">After his expulsion, Álvarez works for the Pentagon before being assassinated in 1989.</font>\r\n</p>	large	f

In the months before CAFTA’s approval, popular mobilizations highlighted the people’s rejection of the trade agreement. They were met with violent police repression and a multi-million dollar government funded pro-CAFTA campaign. The final approval by El Salvador’s Legislative Assembly took place in a midnight session fraught with deal-making and surrounded by hundreds of riot police to keep the protesters at bay.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAlmost five years later, basic living costs have skyrocketed as CAFTA has destroyed the already-neglected agricultural sector and one of the most insidious parts of CAFTA—the investor protection clauses—is just now being revealed. Chapter 10 of the trade agreement contains the articles that allow foreign corporations to sue governments for violating their “right” to profit. Economists like Raul Moreno from El Salvador’s Foundation for the Study of the Application of Law (FESPAD) have been warning the public about these articles since the beginning. Moreno explains that these articles are “the real attack on national sovereignty. If a country takes an action or creates a law to protect its citizens, to protect its workers, or to protect its environment, a foreign company can now sue the country for infringing on their profits.”\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn April 2009, Canadian-based Pacific Rim became the first company operating in El Salvador to file such a lawsuit under CAFTA, suing the country for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. The company is alleging that the government violated CAFTA’s investor protection clauses by not issuing the company mining exploitation permits. As a Canadian company, Pacific Rim is not a party to CAFTA, but it filed the suit through a Reno-based subsidiary that they acquired just before deciding to sue.\r\n</p>	large	f

General Humberto Regalado Hernandez, who was inducted into the School Of Americas' Hall of Fame, was a four-time graduate. As head of the armed forces, he refused to take action against soldiers involved in the Battalion 3-16 death squad. \r\n <br>\r\n&emsp;In 1981, the DEA set up its first office in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, and assigned Thomas Zepeda as the resident agent. Zepeda rapidly came to the accurate conclusion that the entire Honduran government was deeply involved in the drug trade. His attempts to investigate top Honduran officials whom he believed were on Matta's drug payroll were thwarted by the CIA. We know this because Zepeda was quoted as saying as much in a good story in the Los Angeles Times on February 13, 1988 (<i>See below</i>). In May 1983, Zepeda opened an investigation into SETCO. A month later the probe was cut off, Zepeda was pulled out of Honduras, and the DEA's Honduran station was shut down. The man responsible for this retreat was Ed Heath, the DEA's head of Latin American operations, resident in Mexico City and suspected by many DEA agents of being too cozy with the CIA. Former DEA agent Michael Levine described Heath as being &quot;a man so mistrusted by the street agents working for him in Mexico that they conducted enforcement operations without informing him.&quot;\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;In 1985, the GAO was requested to explore the reasons why the DEA shut down the Honduran office. This investigation was also quashed by the NSC and CIA.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n<strong>U.S. Aides Link Honduran Military Chief, Drug Trade</strong> (<i>Excerpt</i>)\r\n<br> &emsp;\r\n Honduras' powerful military chief, Gen. Humberto Regalado Hernandez, is suspected of protecting Colombian drug traffickers who use his country for transshipping cocaine into the United States, Reagan Administration officials said Friday.\r\n<br> &emsp;\r\nAs head of a force that includes Honduras' small navy, which runs the Central American country's Caribbean ports, Regalado "turned a blind eye to drug shipments," a knowledgeable State Department official said. "We can only presume he was paid a price for that. He wasn't doing it out of the goodness of his heart."\r\n<br> &emsp;\r\nThe allegations against Regalado, which stem from U.S. intelligence reports, are only part of a mounting body of evidence that senior members of the military in Honduras, a key U.S. ally in the Contras' war against leftist Nicaragua, are deeply involved in the international cocaine trade, the officials said.\r\n<br> &emsp;\r\n"We don't know the extent of the Honduran military's involvement in drugs," said the State Department official. "But our educated guess is that <strong>all of the senior officers have knowledge, many are involved . . . and they are all reaping the profits.</strong>"\r\n<br> &emsp;\r\n...\r\n<br> &emsp;\r\nSeveral knowledgeable U.S. officials described the situation in Honduras as a minor-league parallel to the case of Panama, where military strongman Manuel A.

Having had decades of peace and stability, Costa Rica and Honduras became the bases for the CIA-formed counterrevolutionary rebels, known as the Contras, in a proxy war against the Sandinistas.

They had offices in Costa Rican cities, and military bases on its side of the border with Nicaragua. Tens of thousands of Costa Ricans took to the streets to demand their country's disentanglement from the war, and President Oscar Arias Sanchez had participated in the five nation Contadora talks.

When the bank's president protested, the administration forced his resignation. The new president reduced Chile's credit rating from B to D. Private banks followed suit, and the Export-Import Bank, citing the reduction, canceled a scheduled $21 million loan intended to pay for new Boeing jets for Chile's national airline. \r\n<br>&emsp; And against Nicaragua under the Sandanistas, the Nicaraguan government sent a loan request to the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in 1985 requesting $100 million to develop its private-sector agriculture. Then US Secretary of State George Shultz sent a letter to the bank threatening to withdraw US support for the bank if the loan was made, but gave no reason as to why this would be the case. A senior IDB official later remarked: &quot;I have never seen such political pressure on the bank as in the last four years.&quot; The blocking of this loan illustrates the hypocrisy of the Reagan administration as the private agricultural sector was the very area that Washington had said it had hoped to preserve against an alleged Marxist takeover. \r\n<br>&emsp; But not all countries have been punished: the brutal Junta in El Salvador was well financed by the bank during both the Carter and Reagan administrations.\r\n</p>	large	f

The vessel in question was the Hope of New London, Connecticut, which limped into port at the Caribbean island of St. Thomas after a harrowing voyage from West Africa. Explaining the death of Captain Gould and two seamen, the surviving sailors described a deadly slave revolt that they said occurred while the Hope was still on the Senegal coast. According to the crew, the forty-three slaves on board at the time suddenly revolted as the vessel was weighing anchor to sail to the nearby island of Goree. In the ensuing fight, the Africans managed to kill the captain and two of his crew before anyone had time to react. However, the rebels then made the fateful mistake of fleeing below deck, where the remainder of the sailors were quickly able to confine them and put an end to the deadly incident. After order was restored. the Hope finally managed to leave the African coast bound for the West Indies, this time under the watch of a new commander, George Taggart, who replaced the fallen Gould. However. the passage was not to be a smooth one, for at some point during the voyage the slaves rose once again, this time killing the ship's carpenter. The crew opened fire on the rebelling slaves, killing seven or eight and thus ending the insurrection. Finally, after the remaining Africans had been placed in double irons to avoid a third rebellion, the vessel made its way to St. Thomas, and the troubled slaving voyage of the Hope came to an end.\r\n<br><font style="font-size:smaller;">&emsp;\r\nA note about the background painting: "<i>Slavers Overthrowing the Dead and Dying-­ Typho[on]n Coming On</i>" (1840), the artist painted his picture specifically for an anti-slavery campaign, and in the left distance the beholder observes the guilty vessel about to meet its deserved end, while in the right and central foreground he encounters thrust upon him slaves being devoured by the sea and its creatures. Although JMW Turner's painting presents images of fanciful ocean predators, his image of Gothic  horror is not the product of his imagination. In fact, he was portraying what had become sound business practice: since insurance on slave-cargoes covered only those drowned at sea and not slaves who perished from brutality, disease, and the dreadful conditions on board, profit-minded captains cast the dead and dying into the ocean. </font>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p></div>	large	f

In doing so, the two organizations &#64257;led a complaint with the United Nations secretary-general in which they listed a series of alleged violations that they claimed would ultimately lead to the disappearance of the Guayaki ethnic group. Most of the killings&mdash;as well as the forcible transfer of Ach&eacute; children&mdash;had been committed by Paraguayan ranchers, farmers, and laborers and not by members of the Paraguayan army or police forces. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nSome scholars and activists argued at the time that de facto genocide had occurred and that the Paraguayan government was responsible due to the fact that it had failed to adequately protect its citizens. It was also argued that the Paraguayan government purposely disregarded the actions against the Ach&eacute; because it\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="page" data-title="Genocide"></div>\r\n<p class="entry" style="width:215px;position:absolute;left:795px;top:5px">\r\n favored the opening up of lands for ranching, farming, and other \r\nuses. During the debate that ensued over the plight and fate of the Ach&eacute;, it was argued by some that the issue of the &ldquo;intent&rdquo; to commit genocide was difficult, if not impossible, to establish in a clear and decisive manner. Leo Kuper (1908&ndash;1994), an early and noted genocide scholar, countered in his book <i>Genocide: Its Political Use in the Twentieth Century</i>, that intent could be imputed when such killings and kidnapping had become an established practice, and, he continued, the latter is exactly what the Ach&eacute; had faced.\r\n\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n<i>Pictured, Aché Indians shortly after they were captured and brought out of the forest to the Aché Reservation.

Before that, according to former Costa Rican CIA station chief Thomas Castillo's public testimony, Hull had helped the CIA with military supply and other operations on behalf of the Contras.  In addition, during the same period, Hull received $10,000 a month from Adolfo Calero of the FDN&#8212;at North's direction.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nHull is an Indiana farmer who lives in northern Costa Rica. He came to Costa Rica in mid-1970's and persuaded a number of North Americans to invest in ranch land in the northern part of the country. Using their money and adding some of his own, he purchased thousands of acres of Costa Rican farm land. Properties under his ownership, management or control ultimately included at least six airstrips. To the many pilots and revolutionaries who passed through the region, this collection of properties and airstrips became known as John Hull's ranch.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOn March 23, 1984, seven men aboard a U.S. government owned DC-3 were killed when the cargo plane crashed near Hull's ranch, revealing publicly that Hull was allowing his property to be used for airdrops of supplies to the Contras. But even before this public revelation of Hull's role in supporting the Contras, officials in a variety of Latin American countries were aware of Hull's activities as a liaison between the Contras and the United States government. Jose Blandon testified, for example, that former Costa Rican Vice President Daniel Oduber suggested he (Blandon) meet with Hull in 1983, to discuss the formation of a unified southern Contra command under Eden Pastora.\r\nFive witnesses testified that Hull was involved in cocaine trafficking: Floyd Carlton, Werner Lotz, Jose Blandon, George Morales, and Gary Betzner. Betzner was the only witness who testified that he was actually present to witness cocaine being loaded onto planes headed for the United States in Hull's presence.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nLotz said that drugs were flown into Hull's ranch, but that he did not personally witness the flights. He said he heard about the drug flights from the Colombian and Panamanian pilots who allegedly flew drugs to Hull's airstrips. Lotz described the strips as "a stop for refuel basically. The aircraft would land, there would be fuel waiting for them, and then would depart. They would come in with weapons and drugs." Lotz said that Hull was paid for allowing his airstrips to be used as a refueling stop.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nTwo witnesses, Blandon and Carlton recounted an incident involving the disappearance of a shipment of 538 kilos of cocaine owned by the Pereira or Cali cocaine cartel. Teofilo Watson, a member of Carlton's smuggling operation, was flying the plane to Costa Rica for the Cartel. The plane crashed and Watson was killed. The witnesses believed that the crash occurred at Hull's ranch and that Hull took the shipment and bulldozed the plane, a Cessna 310, into the river. Carlton testified that the Colombians were furious when they discovered the cocaine missing. He said they sent gunmen after Hull and in fact kidnapped a member of Hull's family to force the return of the cocaine. When that failed they became convinced that Carlton himself stole the cocaine and they sent gunmen after him. The gunmen dug up Carlton's property in Panama with a backhoe looking for the lost cocaine, and Carlton fled for his life to Miami.<br>\r\n<Span class="caption">The Senate Committee Report on Drugs, Law Enforcement and Foreign Policy chaired by Senator John F.

327	The Kennedy-Yarborough strategy 	1963	1963	col1	power	The Culture of Fear, Noam Chomsky	<p class="entry columns"><img src="/mapimages/williamyarborough.jpg" class="floatright" style="max-width:50%;">\r\n&emsp;\r\nThe respected president of the Colombian Permanent Committee for Human Rights, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Alfredo Vasquez Carrizosa, writes that it is “poverty and insufficient land reform” that “have made Colombia one of the most tragic countries of Latin America,” though as elsewhere, “violence has been exacerbated by external factors,” primarily the initiatives of the Kennedy administration, which “took great pains to transform our regular armies into counterinsurgency brigades.” These initiatives ushered in “what is known in Latin America as the National Security Doctrine,” which is not concerned with “defense against an external enemy” but rather “the internal enemy.” The new “strategy of the death squads” accords the military “the right to fight and to exterminate social workers, trade unionists, men and women who are not supportive of the establishment, and who are assumed to be communist extremists.”\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;\r\nAs part of its strategy of converting the Latin American military from “hemispheric defense” to “internal security”—meaning war against the domestic population—Kennedy dispatched a military mission to Colombia in 1962 headed by Special Forces General William Yarborough, <i>pictured</i>. He proposed “reforms” : <span style="color: #cc0000;background-color:black;font-family:helvetica,arial,san-serif;">“A concerted country team effort should be made now to select civilian and military personnel for clandestine training in resistance operations in case they are needed later. This should be done with a view toward development of a civil and military structure for exploitation in the event the Colombian internal security system deteriorates further. This structure should be used to pressure toward reforms known to be needed, perform counter-agent and counter-propaganda functions and as necessary execute paramilitary, sabotage and/or terrorist activities against known communist proponents. It should be backed by the United States.”</span>—the “communist extremists” to whom Vasquez Carrizosa alludes.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&emsp;&quot;Every individual who in one or another manner supports the goals of the enemy must be considered a traitor and treated in that manner,&quot; a 1963 Colombian military manual prescribed, as the Kennedy initiatives were moving into high gear. Since the official goals of the guerrillas are social democratic, the circle of treachery targeted for terror operations is wide.\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;In the years that followed, the Kennedy-Yarborough strategy was developed and applied broadly in &quot;our little region over here,&quot; as the Western hemisphere was described by FDR's Secretary of War Henry Stimson when he was explaining why the US was entitled to control its own regional system while all others were to be dismantled. Violent repression spread throughout Latin America, beginning in the southern cone and reaching its awesome peak in Central America in the 1980s as the stern disciplinarian of the North responded with extreme violence to efforts by the Church and other &quot;subversives&quot; to confront a terrible legacy of misery and repression.</p>	large	f

Inspired by Lempira's example,\r\nrevolt swept the western region, and the Spanish were very nearly\r\nexpelled.</font>\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nOnce the Inca Empire and gold and silver was discovered in the 1530s, the demand for slaves\r\nintensified. Slaves served as crew on the ships to Peru; slaves, even when\r\nnot trusted to fight in the conquest of Peru, functioned as human carriers,\r\nminers, servants, and mistresses, until the Inca themselves could\r\nbe subdued and enslaved. Hundreds of thousands of slaves were sold\r\nand exported to Peru; the number is not known with any certainty, but\r\nsome estimate that as many as a half million Nicaraguans and 150,000\r\nHondurans were exported as slaves. Yet the demand for more remained\r\nhigh; conditions were so wretched aboard ship that in many cases only\r\nfour in every 20 Indian slaves reached their destination alive; those that\r\ndid reach Panama or Peru were literally worked to death. The Indian\r\npopulation in Nicaragua proved inadequate to meet demand. Raids for\r\nable-bodied adults extended down into the Nicoya Peninsula and up\r\ninto El Salvador and Guatemala.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nSome Indians fled to remote regions in the Nicaraguan highlands or\r\nthe forested regions of the Caribbean coast and the Petén. Those who\r\nremained in their towns had little to lose by rebelling, and they did so\r\nfrom their first contact with the Spaniards. The most famous uprising\r\noccurred in Honduras, in the center of the Caribbean slave trade, and was\r\nled by Lempira, the legendary chief of the Lenca Indians, who organized\r\n200 towns and successfully coordinated 30,000 warriors against the\r\nSpanish in 1537; his success inspired rebellions in most of Honduras. The\r\nSpaniards assassinated Lempira during peace negotiations a year later,\r\nbut rebellions continued to erupt in Honduras, El Salvador, and\r\nNicaragua. Indians along the frontier of Spanish settlements mounted\r\nsuccessful guerrilla attacks for years and, in some instances, centuries. African slaves were introduced in the 1540s to fill the growing\r\nlabor shortage.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nIn 1931, Honduras renamed its currency in his honor.\r\n</p>	large	f

Although a very moderate program, the fruit companies shut down Honduran jobs in order to force the government to dilute the measures. The program was revived in 1972 by General Oswaldo López Arellano, who also initiated a National Development Plan. However, he was forced from office and replaced by a military clique that swiftly moved to repress the workers and activists. Two foreign priests and a number of peasant leaders were massacred by the army at Los Horcones in 1975.\r\n<br>&emsp;\r\n In September of 1974, Hurricane Fifi destroyed 60% of Honduras' agricultural production, and Standard Fruit abandoned many of it's plantations. the idled banana workers responded by organizing Las Isletas Peasants Enterprise, whose members planted and harvested bananas collectively and shared the profits. Las Isletas processed over one million boxes of bananas in 1976 and four million in 1977, selling the produce to Standard Fruit. But when Las Isletas decided to market its fruit through the Union of Banana Exporting Countries, Standard pressured the Honduran government to arrest 200 militant members of Las Isletas and ransack the association's headquarters. The Honduran soldiers arrived in Standard Fruit's railroad cars. The successful Las Isletas banana cooperative was destroyed.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n	large	f

111	Bahia Revolt of 1807	1807	1807	bra6	redstar	Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion	<p class="entry columns"><img src="/mapimages/brazil-1807-bahia-slaves.jpg" class="floatright" style="max-width:50%;">\r\n&emsp;The 1807 Bahia rebellion was foiled by the Province government, who had been tipped off by a slave loyal to his master. According to the reports, urban and rural slaves had conspired to join forces to make &quot;War on whites.&quot; Supposedly, they had even planned to capture some of the ships moored in the harbor at Bahia as part of a massive voyage for their anticipated return to Africa. However, the purported goals of the rebel leadership, as related by government sources, represent an extravagant plan that epitomized the fabrications of certain police captains and an inventive spy. \r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;The Hausa (Malê), both slave and free, performed a major role in organizing the revolt. Among the Hausa people, Islam was widely practiced, and the Hausa were well represented within the slave population of Bahia at the time and were considered responsible for many early 19th century rebellions. \r\n<br>&emsp;\r\nAn intricate secret organization appears to have existed among the rebels, with a "captain" in every parish of the city and an overall commander, known as the "ambassador." Both of the principal leaders of the insurrection who were executed, one a slave and the other a free black, were Hausa. The other eleven individuals who were involved in the plot were punished publicly with 150 lashes each to provide an example for those who empathized with the rebels and potential insurectionists. In addition to the floggings, the provincial governor banned all assemblies and festivities that involved Africans and severely restricted the movement of freed Africans in Salvador and Reconcavo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="entry columns3" style="font-size:x-small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;">\r\n&emsp;Divided by color and place of birth, by juridical status and hope of\r\nimprovement, slaves and free people of color did not for the most part\r\nmake common cause. The war against slavery in Bahia was a war\r\ncarried out or led after 1798 almost exclusively by African slaves and by\r\nthose freed persons of African birth for whom ethnicity was more vital\r\nthan juridical status.\r\n<br>&emsp;It is impossible to make a sharp break between the current of endemic\r\nresistance and the outbreak of insurrections around the turn of\r\nthe century. The uprising and flight of the slaves of Engenho Santana\r\nin 1789 was perhaps an early manifestation of the new cycle of resistance,\r\nalthough in that case the leadership was crioulo or cabra and\r\nthere were clear signs of competition with Africans. By 1795, royal\r\nofficials and rural residents were concerned about an increase in fugitive\r\nactivities. Two quilombo settlements in the region of Cachoeira\r\nmoved the government to action. Plantations had been burned, property\r\nstolen, and other slaves induced to run off. The governor dispatched\r\nSeverino Pereira, captain-major of assaults of Itapororocas,\r\nand 200 men to attack the well-fortified mocambo in the Orobó Mountains.\r\nTwo encampments, Orobó and Andrah, were destroyed and\r\nthirteen slaves taken captive, but a great number escaped to another\r\nquilombo, Tupim. The expedition was a traditional response to a\r\nrecurring problem, but the problem seemed to intensify in the opening\r\nyears of the nineteenth century. The governor of Bahia, Joao de Saldanha\r\nda Gama, count of Ponte, launched an active campaign against\r\nquilombos all over the captaincy. In Rio das Contas, the captain of\r\nassaults and a troop of Indians from the Pedra Branca mission were\r\nsent to destroy quilombos in the area but failed. Poor farmers accused\r\nPonte sought to stem the rising tide of resistance because he understood\r\nits potential threat to the captaincy's economy and tranquility.\r\nAlthough 1809 is usually taken as the beginning of the cycle of Bahian\r\nslave rebellions, a plot was uncovered in 1807. The Hausas had\r\nelected a "governor" who had as his "secretary" a free pardo. The\r\npardo had been dispatched to the Reconcavo to enlist the engenho\r\nslaves for a concerted uprising; but when the plot was exposed, the\r\ngovernor threw guards around the city's fountains because of a supposed\r\nthreat to poison the drinking water. The Hausa leaders were\r\ntried for having violated the rights of their masters and for disrupting\r\n"the public tranquillity on which the conservation of states depends. "\r\nA slave and a freedman were sentenced to death, and eleven others\r\nwere flogged. The plot had been revealed by a slave (presumably not a\r\nHausa}, and the arrests brought discovery of two arms caches. The\r\nrebels had sought to rise up on 29 May during the Corpus Christi\r\nfestivities, when security would be lax.\r\n<br>&emsp;Here at the very outset of the insurrectionary cycle, some features\r\ncommon to many of the Bahian revolts were already apparent. Organization\r\nof the movement had apparently been along ethnic lines, in this\r\ncase Hausa. The plotters had sought to take advantage of the distractions\r\nof the colonial religious cycle. Corpus Christi, Holy Week, and\r\nChristmas came to be favored by those who sought freedom, and during\r\nChristmas slaveowners were particularly on guard. Noticeably,\r\nhere in the very first instance, the insurgents had planned to coordinate\r\na rising in the city with a rebellion in the Reconcavo. The mass of\r\nrural slaves held the key to success - and both slaves and masters realized\r\nthis. Salvador provided a milieu for conspiracy, a place where\r\ninteraction and communication between slaves was possible and might\r\npass unnoticed, a locale where freedmen or freedwomen of a particular\r\nethnic group might be enlisted to help. But the key to ultimate success\r\nlay in the mass of slaves at the engenhos and farms of the countryside. The slaves' victory over slavery had to be won in the\r\nReconcavo if it was to be won at all.\r\n<span class="entry_source">SUGAR PLANTATIONS IN THE FORMATION OF BRAZILIAN SOCIETY, Bahia, 1550-1835 STUART B .
